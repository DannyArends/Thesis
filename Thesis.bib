abstract = {1. From Type III pneumococci a biologically active fraction has been isolated in highly purified form which in exceedingly minute amounts is capable under appropriate cultural conditions of inducing the transformation of unencapsulated R variants of Pneumococcus Type II into fully encapsulated cells of the same specific type as that of the heat-killed microorganisms from which the inducing material was recovered. 2. Methods for the isolation and purification of the active transforming material are described. 3. The data obtained by chemical, enzymatic, and serological analyses together with the results of preliminary studies by electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and ultraviolet spectroscopy indicate that, within the limits of the methods, the active fraction contains no demonstrable protein, unbound lipid, or serologically reactive polysaccharide and consists principally, if not solely, of a highly polymerized, viscous form of desoxyribonucleic acid. 4. Evidence is presented that the chemically induced alterations in cellular structure and function are predictable, type-specific, and transmissible in series. The various hypotheses that have been advanced concerning the nature of these changes are reviewed.},

Zool., 19:99–113.—This work provides a means by which it is possible to determine whether two groups of related proteins have a common ancestor or are of independent origin. A set of 16 random amino acid sequences were shown to be unrelated by this method. A set of 16 real but presumably unrelated proteins gave a similar result. A set of 24 model proteins which was composed of two independently evolving groups, converging toward the same chemical goal, was correctly shown to be convergently related, with the probability that the result was due to chance being <10−21. A set of 24 cytochromes composed of 5 fungi and 19 metazoans was shown to be divergently related, with the probability that the result was due to chance being < 10−9. A process was described which leads to the absolute minimum of nucleotide replacements required to account for the divergent descent of a set of genes given a particular topology for the tree depicting their ancestral relations. It was also shown that the convergent processes could realistically lead to amino acid sequences which would produce positive tests for relatedness, not only by a chemical criterion, but by a genetic (nucleotide sequence) criterion as well. Finally, a realistic case is indicated where truly homologous traits, behaving in a perfectly expectable way, may nevertheless lead to a ludicrous phylogeny.},

abstract = {A technique has been developed for the separation of proteins by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Due to its resolution and sensitivity, this technique is a powerful tool for the analysis and detection of proteins from complex biological sources. Proteins are separated according to isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension, and according to molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the second dimension. Since these two parameters are unrelated, it is possible to obtain an almost uniform distribution of protein spots across a two-diminsional gel. This technique has resolved 1100 different components from Escherichia coli and should be capable of resolving a maximum of 5000 proteins. A protein containing as little as one disintegration per min of either 14C or 35S can be detected by autoradiography. A protein which constitutes 10 minus 4 to 10 minus 5\% of the total protein can be detected and quantified by autoradiography. The reproducibility of the separation is sufficient to permit each spot on one separation to be matched with a spot on a different separation. This technique provides a method for estimation (at the described sensitivities) of the number of proteins made by any biological system. This system can resolve proteins differing in a single charge and consequently can be used in the analysis of in vivo modifications resulting in a change in charge. Proteins whose charge is changed by missense mutations can be identified. A detailed description of the methods as well as the characteristics of this system are presented.},

abstract = {Several different methods are currently used by numerous laboratories for the isolation of human neutrophils. These methods include partial purification by dextran sedimentation followed by water lysis, and more complete purification procedures utilizing discontinuous density gradients coupled with dextran sedimentation and in some cases hypotonic lysis. Some investigators refrain from using certain purification schemes because certain steps or reagents used in a particular method might adversely affect the functional parameter of the neutrophil they wish to measure. In spite of these concerns there has been no systematic comparison of the functional status of neutrophils prepared by the various methodologies. In this study we have compared 4 commonly used methods of isolation with neutrophil function. The results of this study indicate that while neutrophil yield and purity were determined by isolation procedure, all cells were equivalent with regard to chemotactic performance, ability to degranulate, and ability to produce superoxide and hypochlorous acid.},

Many human diseases and traits, however, can be expected to be genetically heterogeneous (i.e., caused by any one of several genes), and traditional linkage analysis is much less effective in such circumstances. We present two methods, interval mapping and simultaneous search, designed to exploit the full power of a linkage map of the DNA markers. For the simplest situations, only 1/3 as many affected families are needed to map a heterogeneous trait by using these methods. Only 1/5-1/50 as many are needed to detect that genetic heterogeneity is present.},

The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

abstract = {An efficient strategy for mapping human genes that cause recessive traits has been devised that uses mapped restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and the DNA of affected children from consanguineous marriages. The method involves detection of the disease locus by virtue of the fact that the adjacent region will preferentially be homozygous by descent in such inbred children. A single affected child of a first-cousin marriage is shown to contain the same total information about linkage as a nuclear family with three affected children. Calculations show that it should be practical to map a recessive disease gene by studying DNA from fewer than a dozen unrelated, affected inbred children, given a complete RFLP linkage map. The method should make it possible to map many recessive diseases for which it is impractical or impossible to collect adequate numbers of families with multiple affected offspring.},

abstract = {In Arabidopsis thaliana, seed development in recombinants of the ABA-deficient aba mutant with the ABA response mutants abi1 or abi3 is compared to wild type and the monogenic parents. Aberrant seed development occurred in the aba,abi3 recombinant and was normal in aba,abi1, abi3 and aba,abi1 seeds. Embryos of the recombinant aba,abi3 seeds maintained the green color until maturity, the seeds kept a high water content, did not form the late abundant 2S and 12S storage proteins, were desiccation intolerant, and often showed viviparous germination. Application of ABA, and particularly of an ABA analog, to the roots of plants during seed development partially alleviated the aberrant phenotype. Seeds of aba,abi3 were normal when they developed on a mother plant heterozygous for Aba. In contrast to seed development, the induction of dormancy was blocked in all monogenic mutants and recombinants. Dormancy was only induced by embryonic ABA; it could not be increased by maternal ABA or ABA applied to the mother plant. It is concluded that endogenous ABA has at least two different effects in developing seeds. The nature of these responses and of the ABA response system is discussed.},

abstract = {The use of flanking marker methods has proved to be a powerful tool for the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the segregating generations derived from crosses between inbred lines. Methods to analyse these data, based on maximum-likelihood, have been developed and provide good estimates of QTL effects in some situations. Maximum-likelihood methods are, however, relatively complex and can be computationally slow. In this paper we develop methods for mapping QTL based on multiple regression which can be applied using any general statistical package. We use the example of mapping in an F(2) population and show that these regression methods produce very similar results to those obtained using maximum likelihood. The relative simplicity of the regression methods means that models with more than a single QTL can be explored and we give examples of two lined loci and of two interacting loci. Other models, for example with more than two QTL, with environmental fixed effects, with between family variance or for threshold traits, could be fitted in a similar way. The ease, speed of application and generality of regression methods for flanking marker analysis, and the good estimates they obtain, suggest that they should provide the method of choice for the analysis of QTL mapping data from inbred line crosses.},

abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa, creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node. Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences. At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover, in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency. When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction is on the average around 20\%. With highly-varying-rate trees and with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately 1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above 50\%, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented by as much as 15\%.},

Arrays containing up to 2,479 yeast ORFs were printed on a single slide. The hybridization of fluorescently labeled samples to the array were detected and quantitated with a laser confocal scanning microscope. Applications of the microarrays are shown for genetic and gene expression analysis at the whole genome level.},

abstract = {The influence of genetic factors on psychological traits and disorders has been repeatedly demonstrated; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying such an influence remain largely unknown. Anxiety-related disorders constitute the most common class of mental disorder in humans, with women being diagnosed far more frequently than men. A better understanding of the genetic and gender-related mechanisms mediating anxiety traits should enable the development of more rational methods for preventing and treating anxiety disorders. In this study we have aimed to identify, for the first time, quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing anxiety/emotionality-related traits in rats. To this end, two strains-Lewis (LEW) and Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR)-that differ for several behavioral measures of anxiety/emotionality were intercrossed. A QTL analysis of the F2 population revealed suggestive loci for various traits, including behaviors in the elevated plus-maze and blood pressure. In addition, one major QTL explaining 50.4\% of the total variance (LOD = 7.22) was identified on chromosome 4 for the locomotion in the central and aversive area of the open field. Two other relevant QTLs have been recently mapped near this chromosomic region in the rat, which also harbors Tac1r, the gene encoding for the substance P receptor. Our major QTL affected females but not males and its effect depended on the type of cross (LEW or SHR grandmothers). The present results reveal a complex genetic basis underlying emotional behaviors and they confirm the existence of interactions between genetic factors and sex for this kind of trait. Further investigation of the loci identified herein may give clues to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety-related ones.},

abstract = {Genetic analyses for loci regulating bone mineral density have been conducted in a cohort of F(2) mice derived from intercross matings of (C57BL/6J x CAST/EiJ)F(1) parents. Femurs were isolated from 714 4-month-old females when peak adult bone density had been achieved. Bone mineral density (BMD) data were obtained by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), and genotype data were obtained by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays for polymorphic markers carried in genomic DNA of each mouse. Genome-wide scans for co-segregation of genetic marker data with high or low BMD revealed loci on eight different chromosomes, four of which (Chrs 1, 5, 13, and 15) achieved conservative statistical criteria for suggestive, significant, or highly significant linkage with BMD. These four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were confirmed by a linear regression model developed to describe the main effects; none of the loci exhibited significant interaction effects by ANOVA. The four QTLs have been named Bmd1 (Chr 1), Bmd2 (Chr 5), Bmd3 (Chr 13), and Bmd4 (Chr 15). Additive effects were observed for Bmd1, recessive for Bmd3, and dominant effects for Bmd2 and Bmd4. The current large size of the QTL regions (6-->31 cM) renders premature any discussion of candidate genes at this time. Fine mapping of these QTLs is in progress to refine their genetic positions and to evaluate human homologies.},

abstract = {We have analyzed two Arabidopsis strains differing in the mean seed size and seed number they produced. The accession Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) yielded on average about 40\% fewer seeds than the laboratory strain Landsberg erecta (Ler), but Cvi seeds were almost twice as heavy. Maternal and nonmaternal genetic factors were involved in the seed size variation, and interactions between both types of factors presumably occurred. The Ler/Cvi seed size difference increased through seed development from ovule maturation until seed desiccation, suggesting that multiple processes of seed development were affected. In addition, it involved changes in the final cell number and cell size of the seed coat and the embryo. Cell number variation was controlled mainly by maternal factors, whereas nonmaternal allelic variation mostly affected cell size. By using a recombinant inbred line population derived from Ler and Cvi, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting 12 life history traits related to seed size, fruit size, seed number, and plant resources. Five of the seed size QTLs colocated with QTLs for other traits, suggesting that they control seed size via maternal components affecting ovule number and/or carpel development, ovule development, or reproductive resource allocation in the mother plant. The six remaining putative seed size QTLs did not show a significant effect on any other trait, suggesting that this allelic variation may be involved specifically in seed development processes.},

De Vries's work in the 1890s can be characterized as an attempt to defend his theory of pangenes, especially the fundamental and controversial idea that different characters have different material hereditary carriers. Hybridization experiments served his goal. Recently discovered research notes on hybridization from 1896 suggest that, though he was unaware of Mendel's work, De Vries used the laws of dominance and recessiveness, segregation, and independent assortment to explain the 75:25 ratio in the second generation. He had discovered these laws by applying insights from probability theory to his research. In Die Mutationstheorie De Vries combined central concepts of intracellular pangenesis and his mutation theory by modifying the meanings of important terms and introducing new states of pangenes. In his attempts to describe Mendelian crossings in terms of pangenes and mutations, he became entangled in a number of contradictions. Some of his remarks suggest that he was aware that the Mendelian laws and his own theories of pangenes and mutations could not be made consistent.},

From this data we determined 214 proposed ancestral alleles (the sequence found in the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees). In a diverse human population set, we found that SNP alleles with higher frequencies were more likely to be ancestral than less frequently occurring alleles. There were, however, exceptions. We also found three shared human/pygmy chimpanzee polymorphisms, all involving CpG dinucleotides, and two shared human/gorilla polymorphisms, one involving a CpG dinucleotide.

Score matrices for database search programs or phylogenetic analysis rely on such models of protein evolution. Pioneering work was done by Dayhoff et al. (1978) who formulated a Markov model of evolution and derived the famous PAM score matrices. Her estimation procedure for amino acid exchange frequencies is restricted to pairs of proteins that have a constant and small degree of divergence. Here we present an improved estimator, called the resolvent method, that is not subject to these limitations. This extension of Dayhoff's approach enables us to estimate an amino acid substitution model from alignments of varying degree of divergence. Extensive simulations show the capability of the new estimator to recover accurately the exchange frequencies among amino acids. Based on the SYSTERS database of aligned protein families (Krause and Vingron, 1998) we recompute a series of score matrices.},

abstract = {Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) has been known in mammals to be a key enzyme of the catabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids. We have isolated two cDNA clones encoding the E1beta and E2 subunits of BCKDH, respectively, from Arabidopsis thaliana. Proteins encoded in these cDNA sequences had putative mitochondrial targeting sequences and conserved domains reported for their mammalian counterparts. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses showed that transcripts from the respective genes and E2 protein markedly accumulated in leaves kept in the dark. We found that the activity of BCKDH in the leaf extracts also increased when plants were placed in the dark. Addition of sucrose to detached leaves inhibited the accumulation of transcripts, whereas application of a photosynthesis inhibitor strongly induced the expression of these genes even under light illumination. These observations indicate that the cellular sugar level is likely responsible for the dark-induced expression of these genes. The transcript levels of these genes were also high in senescing leaves, in which photosynthetic activity is low and free amino acids from degraded protein are likely to serve as an alternative energy source.},

Further, the reproducibility of the method was high: the error occurring in the analysis procedures was found to be less than 6\% for 30 out of 33 compounds tested. Biological variability exceeded the systematic error of the analysis by a factor of up to 10. The method is also suited for upscaling, potentially allowing the simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples. As a first example this method has been applied to soil- and in vitro-grown tubers. Due to the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of metabolites it was immediately apparent that these systems differ significantly in their metabolism. Furthermore, the parallel insight into many pathways allows some conclusions to be drawn about the underlying physiological differences between both tuber systems. As a second example, transgenic lines modified in sucrose catabolism or starch synthesis were analysed. This example illustrates the power of an unbiased approach to detecting unexpected changes in transgenic lines.},

abstract = {Multiparallel analyses of mRNA and proteins are central to today's functional genomics initiatives. We describe here the use of metabolite profiling as a new tool for a comparative display of gene function. It has the potential not only to provide deeper insight into complex regulatory processes but also to determine phenotype directly. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we automatically quantified 326 distinct compounds from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf extracts. It was possible to assign a chemical structure to approximately half of these compounds. Comparison of four Arabidopsis genotypes (two homozygous ecotypes and a mutant of each ecotype) showed that each genotype possesses a distinct metabolic profile. Data mining tools such as principal component analysis enabled the assignment of "metabolic phenotypes" using these large data sets. The metabolic phenotypes of the two ecotypes were more divergent than were the metabolic phenotypes of the single-loci mutant and their parental ecotypes. These results demonstrate the use of metabolite profiling as a tool to significantly extend and enhance the power of existing functional genomics approaches.},

abstract = {Secondary metabolites are a diverse set of plant compounds believed to have numerous functions in plant-environment interactions. The large chemical diversity of secondary metabolites undoubtedly arises from an equally diverse set of enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis. However, little is known about the evolution of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. We are studying the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, a large group of secondary metabolites, in Arabidopsis to investigate the evolution of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. Arabidopsis contains natural variations in the presence of methylsulfinylalkyl, alkenyl, and hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates. In this article, we report the identification of genes encoding two 2-oxoglutarate--dependent dioxygenases that are responsible for this variation. These genes, AOP2 and AOP3, which map to the same position on chromosome IV, result from an apparent gene duplication and control the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate to either the alkenyl or the hydroxyalkyl form. By heterologous expression in Escherichia and the correlation of gene expression patterns to the glucosinolate phenotype, we show that AOP2 catalyzes the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates to alkenyl glucosinolates. Conversely, AOP3 directs the formation of hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates from methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates. No ecotype coexpressed both genes. Furthermore, the absence of functional AOP2 and AOP3 leads to the accumulation of the precursor methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates. A third member of this gene family, AOP1, is present in at least two forms and found in all ecotypes examined. However, its catalytic role is still uncertain.},

abstract = {We have undertaken a systematic reverse genetic approach to understand R2R3-MYB gene function in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the functional characterization of MYB61 based on the phenotype of three independent insertion alleles. Wide-ranging phenotype screens indicated that MYB61 mutants were deficient in seed mucilage extrusion upon imbibition. This phenotype was expressed in the sporophytic tissues of the seed. Deposition and extrusion of the principal component of the mucilage, a relatively unbranched rhamnogalacturonan, were reduced in the MYB61 mutant seed coats. Additional defects in the maturation of the testa epidermal cells suggested a potential deficiency in extracellular secretion in myb61 lines. Consistent with a proposed role in testa development, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed the highest MYB61 expression in siliques, which was localized to the seed coat by a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene fusion. Lower levels of GUS expression were detected in developing vascular tissue. Parallel analysis of the ttg1-1 mutant phenotype indicated that this mutant showed more severe developmental defects than myb61 and suggested that MYB61 may function in a genetic pathway distinct from that of TTG1. The transient nature of seed epidermal characteristics in the ttg1-1 mutant suggested that TTG1 was required for maintenance rather than initiation of testa epidermal differentiation. Germination and seedling establishment were compromised in the myb61 and ttg1-1 mutants under conditions of reduced water potential, suggesting a function for Arabidopsis seed mucilage during germination in dry conditions.},

Adverse environmental conditions, such as those causing abiotic stress, often cause significant losses in crop productivity and quality. Because of a paucity of well-defined visible phenotypes, conventional genetic screens have not been very successful in isolating abiotic stress signal transduction mutants of plants. Here, we describe a reporter gene-based strategy to screen for mutants affected in abiotic stress-regulated gene transcription. Our genetic screen uses the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by the cold, drought, salt, and abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive RD29A promoter (RD29A::LUC). Arabidopsis plants transformed with the RD29A::LUC reporter emit bioluminescence in response to cold, drought, salt, or ABA treatment. After mutagenesis of these plants with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), mutants can be screened from the M2 population by monitoring the level of stress-inducible bioluminescence with a high-throughput, low-light imaging system. This protocol describes in detail the procedures for this luciferase reporter-based genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants defective in abiotic stress signaling.},

abstract = {The little success of breeding approaches toward the improvement of salt tolerance in crop species is thought to be attributable to the quantitative nature of most, if not all the processes implicated. Hence, the identification of some of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to natural variation in salt tolerance should be instrumental in eventually manipulating the perception of salinity and the corresponding responses. A good choice to reach this goal is the plant model system Arabidopsis, whose complete genome sequence is now available. Aiming to analyze natural variability in salt tolerance, we have compared the ability of 102 wild-type races (named ecotypes or accessions) of Arabidopsis to germinate on 250 mM NaCl, finding a wide range of variation among them. Accessions displaying extremely different responses to NaCl were intercrossed, and the phenotypes found in their F(2) progenies suggested that natural variation in NaCl tolerance during germination was under polygenic controls. Genetic distances calculated on the basis of variations in repeat number at 22 microsatellites, were analyzed in a group of either extremely salt-tolerant or extremely salt-sensitive accessions. We found that most but not all accessions with similar responses to NaCl are phylogenetically related. NaCl tolerance was also studied in 100 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the Columbia-4 and Landsberg erecta accessions. We detected 11 QTL harboring naturally occurring alleles that contribute to natural variation in NaCl tolerance in Arabidopsis, six at the germination and five at the vegetative growth stages, respectively. At least five of these QTL are likely to represent loci not yet described by their relationship with salt stress.},

We evaluate the methods using a highly divergent and inhomogeneous set of sequence alignments as an input to the estimation procedure. ML is the method of choice for small sets of input data. Although the RV method is computationally much less demanding it performs only slightly worse than ML. Therefore, it is perfectly appropriate for large-scale applications.},

abstract = {Natural genetic variation in Arabidopsis is considerable, but has not yet been used extensively as a source of variants to identify new genes of interest. From the cross between two genetically distant ecotypes, Bay-0 and Shahdara, we generated a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population dedicated to Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping. A set of 38 physically anchored microsatellite markers was created to construct a robust genetic map from the 420 F6 lines. These markers, evenly distributed throughout the five chromosomes, revealed a remarkable equilibrium in the segregation of parental alleles in the genome. As a model character, we have analysed the genetic basis of variation in flowering time in two different environments. The simultaneous mapping of both large- and small-effect QTLs responsible for this variation explained 90\% of the total genotypic variance. Two of the detected QTLs colocalize very precisely with FRIGIDA and FLOWERING LOCUS C genes; we provide information on the polymorphism of genes confirming this hypothesis. Another QTL maps in a region where no QTL had been found previously for this trait.

@article{Consoli2002,
abstract = {In this review, we present some studies on genetic analysis of proteome and transcriptome variations, which exemplify new strategies for a better understanding of the molecular and genetic bases of complex traits. A large genetic variability was revealed at the proteome expression level, which raised the possibility to predict phenotypical performance on the basis of gene product variability. This approach yielded limited results, but could be re-newed by extensive identification of proteins now allowed by mass spectrometry. The dissection of the genetic basis of the variation of individual protein amounts proves very powerful to select 'candidate' proteins, physiologically relevant for a given phenotypical trait, as shown by a study on the effect of water stress in maize. In order to investigate factors of grain quality in maize, we selected a regulatory locus known to control the expression of several storage protein genes, Opaque-2, and investigated the relationships between variability in zein amount and composition and the molecular polymorphism at this locus. Moreover, a QTL analysis revealed that the variability in Opaque-2 transcript abundance was controlled by several polymorphic trans-acting regulators unlinked to the Opaque-2 structural gene. Such genetic approaches should represent additional tools for physiological analysis of the huge amounts of data generated by transcritome and proteome projects.},

abstract = {HGVbase (Human Genome Variation database; http://hgvbase.cgb.ki.se, formerly known as HGBASE) is an academic effort to provide a high quality and non-redundant database of available genomic variation data of all types, mostly comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Records include neutral polymorphisms as well as disease-related mutations. Online search tools facilitate data interrogation by sequence similarity and keyword queries, and searching by genome coordinates is now being implemented. Downloads are freely available in XML, Fasta, SRS, SQL and tagged-text file formats. Each entry is presented in the context of its surrounding sequence and many records are related to neighboring human genes and affected features therein. Population allele frequencies are included wherever available. Thorough semi-automated data checking ensures internal consistency and addresses common errors in the source information. To keep pace with recent growth in the field, we have developed tools for fully automated annotation. All variants have been uniquely mapped to the draft genome sequence and are referenced to positions in EMBL/GenBank files. Data utility is enhanced by provision of genotyping assays and functional predictions. Recent data structure extensions allow the capture of haplotype and genotype information, and a new initiative (along with BiSC and HUGO-MDI) aims to create a central repository for the broad collection of clinical mutations and associated disease phenotypes of interest.},

Over 1500 genes were differentially expressed between the parent strains. Expression levels of 570 genes were linked to one or more different loci, with most expression levels showing complex inheritance patterns. The loci detected by linkage fell largely into two categories: cis-acting modulators of single genes and trans-acting modulators of many genes. We found eight such trans-acting loci, each affecting the expression of a group of 7 to 94 genes of related function.},

@article{Fowler:2002,
abstract = {The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology-from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET-the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them. The topics covered include: Dividing an enterprise application into layers The major approaches to organizing business logic An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions Designing distributed object interfaces 0321127420B10152002},

@article{Badano2003,
abstract = {Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, the primary features of which include obesity, retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, learning difficulties, and renal malformations. Conventional linkage and positional cloning have led to the mapping of six BBS loci in the human genome, four of which (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, and BBS6) have been cloned. Despite these advances, the protein sequences of the known BBS genes have provided little or no insight into their function. To delineate functionally important regions in BBS2, we performed phylogenetic and genomic studies in which we used the human and zebrafish BBS2 peptide sequences to search dbEST and the translation of the draft human genome. We identified two novel genes that we initially named "BBS2L1" and "BBS2L2" and that exhibit modest similarity with two discrete, overlapping regions of BBS2. In the present study, we demonstrate that BBS2L1 mutations cause BBS, thereby defining a novel locus for this syndrome, BBS7, whereas BBS2L2 has been shown independently to be BBS1. The motif-based identification of a novel BBS locus has enabled us to define a potential functional domain that is present in three of the five known BBS proteins and, therefore, is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of this complex syndrome.},

abstract = {Improving plant nitrogen (N) use efficiency or controlling soil N requires a better knowledge of the regulation of plant N metabolism. This could be achieved using Arabidopsis as a model genetic system, taking advantage of the natural variation available among ecotypes. Here, we describe an extensive study of N metabolism variation in the Bay-0 x Shahdara recombinant inbred line population, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We mapped QTL for traits such as shoot growth, total N, nitrate, and free-amino acid contents, measured in two contrasting N environments (contrasting nitrate availability in the soil), in controlled conditions. Genetic variation and transgression were observed for all traits, and most of the genetic variation was identified through QTL and QTL x QTL epistatic interactions. The 48 significant QTL represent at least 18 loci that are polymorphic between parents; some may correspond to known genes from the N metabolic pathway, but others represent new genes controlling or interacting with N physiology. The correlations between traits are dissected through QTL colocalizations: The identification of the individual factors contributing to the regulation of different traits sheds new light on the relations among these characters. We also point out that the regulation of our traits is mostly specific to the N environment (N availability). Finally, we describe four interesting loci at which positional cloning is feasible.},

abstract = {During angiosperm reproduction, pollen grains form a tube that navigates through female tissues to the micropyle, delivering sperm to the egg; the signals that mediate this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe a role for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in pollen tube growth and guidance. In vitro, GABA stimulates pollen tube growth, although vast excesses are inhibitory. The Arabidopsis POP2 gene encodes a transaminase that degrades GABA and contributes to the formation of a gradient leading up to the micropyle. pop2 flowers accumulate GABA, and the growth of many pop2 pollen tubes is arrested, consistent with their in vitro GABA hypersensitivity. Some pop2 tubes continue to grow toward ovules, yet they are misguided, presumably because they target ectopic GABA on the ovule surface. Interestingly, wild-type tubes exhibit normal growth and guidance in pop2 pistils, perhaps by degrading excess GABA and sharpening the gradient leading to the micropyle.},

In the case of a quantitative outcome, the tree predictor takes on a numerical value. We applied Random Forest to the first replicate of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 13 simulated data set, with the sibling pairs as our units of analysis and identity by descent (IBD) at selected loci as our explanatory variables. With the knowledge of the true model, we performed two sets of analyses on three phenotypes: HDL, triglycerides, and glucose. The goal was to approach the mapping of complex traits from a multivariate perspective. The first set of analyses mimics a candidate gene approach with a high proportion of true genes among the predictors while the second set represents a genome scan analysis using microsatellite markers. Random Forest was able to identify a few of the major genes influencing the phenotypes, such as baseline HDL and triglycerides, but failed to identify the major genes regulating baseline glucose levels.},

abstract = {The PHASE software package allows phylogenetic tree construction with a number of evolutionary models designed specifically for use with RNA sequences that have conserved secondary structure. Evolution in the paired regions of RNAs occurs via compensatory substitutions, hence changes on either side of a pair are correlated. Accounting for this correlation is important for phylogenetic inference because it affects the likelihood calculation. In the present study we use the complete set of tRNA and rRNA sequences from 69 complete mammalian mitochondrial genomes. The likelihood calculation uses two evolutionary models simultaneously for different parts of the sequence: a paired-site model for the paired sites and a single-site model for the unpaired sites. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to obtain the most probable trees and posterior probabilities of clades. The results are well resolved for almost all the important branches on the mammalian tree. They support the arrangement of mammalian orders within the four supra-ordinal clades that have been identified by studies of much larger data sets mainly comprising nuclear genes. Groups such as the hedgehogs and the murid rodents, which have been problematic in previous studies with mitochondrial proteins, appear in their expected position with the other members of their order. Our choice of genes and evolutionary model appears to be more reliable and less subject to biases caused by variation in base composition than previous studies with mitochondrial genomes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genomic research laboratories need adequate infrastructure to support management of their data production and research workflow. But what makes infrastructure adequate? A lack of appropriate criteria makes any decision on buying or developing a system difficult. Here, we report on the decision process for the case of a molecular genetics group establishing a microarray laboratory. RESULTS: Five typical requirements for experimental genomics database systems were identified: (i) evolution ability to keep up with the fast developing genomics field; (ii) a suitable data model to deal with local diversity; (iii) suitable storage of data files in the system; (iv) easy exchange with other software; and (v) low maintenance costs. The computer scientists and the researchers of the local microarray laboratory considered alternative solutions for these five requirements and chose the following options: (i) use of automatic code generation; (ii) a customized data model based on standards; (iii) storage of datasets as black boxes instead of decomposing them in database tables; (iv) loosely linking to other programs for improved flexibility; and (v) a low-maintenance web-based user interface. Our team evaluated existing microarray databases and then decided to build a new system, Molecular Genetics Information System (MOLGENIS), implemented using code generation in a period of three months. This case can provide valuable insights and lessons to both software developers and a user community embarking on large-scale genomic projects. AVAILABILITY: http://www.molgenis.nl},

@article{Smith2004,
abstract = {Empirical models of substitution are often used in protein sequence analysis because the large alphabet of amino acids requires that many parameters be estimated in all but the simplest parametric models. When information about structure is used in the analysis of substitutions in structured RNA, a similar situation occurs. The number of parameters necessary to adequately describe the substitution process increases in order to model the substitution of paired bases. We have developed a method to obtain substitution rate matrices empirically from RNA alignments that include structural information in the form of base pairs. Our data consisted of alignments from the European Ribosomal RNA Database of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Small Subunit and Large Subunit Ribosomal RNA ( Wuyts et al. 2001. Nucleic Acids Res. 29:175-177; Wuyts et al. 2002. Nucleic Acids Res. 30:183-185). Using secondary structural information, we converted each sequence in the alignments into a sequence over a 20-symbol code: one symbol for each of the four individual bases, and one symbol for each of the 16 ordered pairs. Substitutions in the coded sequences are defined in the natural way, as observed changes between two sequences at any particular site. For given ranges (windows) of sequence divergence, we obtained substitution frequency matrices for the coded sequences. Using a technique originally developed for modeling amino acid substitutions ( Veerassamy, Smith, and Tillier. 2003. J. Comput. Biol. 10:997-1010), we were able to estimate the actual evolutionary distance for each window. The actual evolutionary distances were used to derive instantaneous rate matrices, and from these we selected a universal rate matrix. The universal rate matrices were incorporated into the Phylip Software package ( Felsenstein 2002. http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html), and we analyzed the ribosomal RNA alignments using both distance and maximum likelihood methods. The empirical substitution models performed well on simulated data, and produced reasonable evolutionary trees for 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from sequenced Bacterial genomes. Empirical models have the advantage of being easily implemented, and the fact that the code consists of 20 symbols makes the models easily incorporated into existing programs for protein sequence analysis. In addition, the models are useful for simulating the evolution of RNA sequence and structure simultaneously.},

While the full 3D structure is very difficult to determine, the 2D structure of an RNA molecule gives good clues to its 3D structure, and for molecules of moderate length, it can be predicted with good reliability. Structure comparison is, in analogy to sequence comparison, the essential technique to infer related function. We provide a method for computing multiple alignments of RNA secondary structures under the tree alignment model, which is suitable to cluster RNA molecules purely on the structural level, i.e., sequence similarity is not required. We give a systematic generalization of the profile alignment method from strings to trees and forests. We introduce a tree profile representation of RNA secondary structure alignments which allows reasonable scoring in structure comparison. Besides the technical aspects, an RNA profile is a useful data structure to represent multiple structures of RNA sequences. Moreover, we propose a visualization of RNA consensus structures that is enriched by the full sequence information.},

Furthermore, the effects of heat stress, salt (NaCl) stress, osmotic (mannitol) stress, and natural aging were analyzed.

Recently, progress has been made in identifying components of signalling pathways involved in salt, drought and cold stresses. Genetic analysis has defined the Salt-Overly-Sensitive (SOS) pathway, in which a salt stress-induced calcium signal is probably sensed by the calcium-binding protein SOS3 which then activates the protein kinase SOS2. The SOS3-SOS2 kinase complex regulates the expression and activity of ion transporters such as SOS1 to re-establish cellular ionic homeostasis under salinity. The ICE1 (Inducer of CBF Expression 1)-CBF (C-Repeat Binding Protein) pathway is critical for the regulation of the cold-responsive transcriptome and acquired freezing tolerance, although at present the signalling events that activate the ICE1 transcription factor during cold stress are not known. Both ABA-dependent and -independent signalling pathways appear to be involved in osmotic stress tolerance. Components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades may act as converging points of multiple abiotic as well as biotic stress signalling pathways. Forward and reverse genetic analysis in combination with expression profiling will continue to uncover many signalling components, and biochemical characterization of the signalling complexes will be required to determine specificity and cross-talk in abiotic stress signalling pathways.},

@article{Moreau:2004,
abstract = {A population of 300 F(3:4) lines derived from the cross between maize inbred lines F2 and F252 was evaluated for testcross value in a large range of environmental conditions (11 different locations in 2 years: 1995 and 1996) in order to study (1) the magnitude of genotype x environment and (2) the stability of quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects. Several agronomic traits were measured: dry grain yield (DGY), kernel weight, average number of kernels per plant, silking date (SD) and grain moisture at harvest. A large genotype x environment interaction was found, particularly for DGY. A hierarchical classification of trials and an additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model were carried out. Both methods led to the conclusion that trials could be partitioned into three groups consistent with (1) the year of experiment and (2) the water availability (irrigated vs non-irrigated) for the trials sown in 1995. QTL detection was carried out for all the traits in the different groups of trials. Between 9 and 15 QTL were detected for each trait. QTL x group and QTL x trial effects were tested and proved significant for a large proportion of QTL. QTL detection was also performed on coordinates on the first two principal components (PC) of the AMMI model. PC QTL were generally detected in areas where QTL x group and QTL x trial interactions were significant. A region located on chromosome 8 near an SD QTL seemed to play a key role in DGY stability. Our results confirm the key role of water availability and flowering earliness on grain yield stability in maize.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In phylogenetic analysis we face the problem that several subclade topologies are known or easily inferred and well supported by bootstrap analysis, but basal branching patterns cannot be unambiguously estimated by the usual methods (maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ), or maximum likelihood (ML)), nor are they well supported. We represent each subclade by a sequence profile and estimate evolutionary distances between profiles to obtain a matrix of distances between subclades. RESULTS: Our estimator of profile distances generalizes the maximum likelihood estimator of sequence distances. The basal branching pattern can be estimated by any distance-based method, such as neighbor-joining. Our method (profile neighbor-joining, PNJ) then inherits the accuracy and robustness of profiles and the time efficiency of neighbor-joining. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis of Chlorophyceae with traditional methods (MP, NJ, ML and MrBayes) reveals seven well supported subclades, but the methods disagree on the basal branching pattern. The tree reconstructed by our method is better supported and can be confirmed by known morphological characters. Moreover the accuracy is significantly improved as shown by parametric bootstrap.},

abstract = {Quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control seed oil content and fatty acid composition were studied using a recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between the Arabidopsis ecotypes Landsberg erecta and Cape Verdi Islands. Multiple QTL model mapping identified two major and two minor QTL that account for 43\% of the variation in oil content in the population. The most significant QTL is at the bottom of chromosome 2 and accounts for 17\% of the genetic variation. Two other significant QTL, located on the upper and lower arms of chromosome 1, account for a further 19\% of the genetic variation. A QTL near to the top of chomosome 3 is epistatic to that on the upper arm of chromosome 1. There are strong QTL for linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids contents that colocate with the FAD3 locus, another for oleic acid (18:1) that colocates with FAD2 and other less significant QTL for palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), and eicosaenoic (20:1) acids. The presence of the QTL for seed oil content on chromosome 2 was confirmed by the generation of lines that contain a 22-cM region of Landsberg erecta DNA at the bottom of chromosome 2 in a background containing Cape Verdi Islands in other regions of the genome that had been shown to influence oil content in the QTL analysis.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana provides a scientifically attractive and simple model for studying root growth and architecture and, subsequently, for discovering new genes involved in the control of these characters in plants. We have used the natural variation available in Arabidopsis accessions and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for primary root length (PRL), lateral root number (LRN) and density (LRD) and for total length of the lateral root system (LRL) in the Bay-0 x Shahdara population. Total phenotypic variation was very large, and despite the importance of the environmental component we were able to map 13 QTLs and one epistatic interaction between QTLs. Our results highlight the biological relevance and genetic control of lateral root density in this material. We were also able to show that variation in the extent of the lateral root system depends mainly on the growth of the existing lateral roots rather than in a change in LRN. Factors controlling lateral root growth seemed to have no major effect on primary root growth. Moreover, Shahdara QTL alleles always increased the length of the lateral roots, which may be taken as an adaptation to its very dry natural environment in Tadjikistan. A QTL for PRL was confirmed using a type of near-isogenic line called a heterogeneous inbred family (HIF), and this QTL is a candidate for further fine-mapping and cloning.},

abstract = {Interactions between polymorphisms at different quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are thought to contribute to the genetics of many traits, and can markedly affect the power of genetic studies to detect QTLs. Interacting loci have been identified in many organisms. However, the prevalence of interactions, and the nucleotide changes underlying them, are largely unknown. Here we search for naturally occurring genetic interactions in a large set of quantitative phenotypes--the levels of all transcripts in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each transcript, we searched for secondary loci interacting with primary QTLs detected by their individual effects. Such locus pairs were estimated to be involved in the inheritance of 57\% of transcripts; statistically significant pairs were identified for 225 transcripts. Among these, 67\% of secondary loci had individual effects too small to be significant in a genome-wide scan. Engineered polymorphisms in isogenic strains confirmed an interaction between the mating-type locus MAT and the pheromone response gene GPA1. Our results indicate that genetic interactions are widespread in the genetics of transcript levels, and that many QTLs will be missed by single-locus tests but can be detected by two-stage tests that allow for interactions.},

abstract = {The ongoing characterization of novel species creates the need for a molecular marker which can be used for species- and, simultaneously, for mega-systematics. Recently, the use of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence was suggested, as it shows a high divergence in sequence with an assumed conservation in structure. This hypothesis was mainly based on small-scale analyses, comparing a limited number of sequences. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of more than 54,000 currently known ITS2 sequences with the goal to evaluate the hypothesis of a conserved structural core and to assess its use for automated large-scale phylogenetics. Structure prediction revealed that the previously described core structure can be found for more than 5000 sequences in a wide variety of taxa within the eukaryotes, indicating that the core secondary structure is indeed conserved. This conserved structure allowed an automated alignment of extremely divergent sequences as exemplified for the ITS2 sequences of a ctenophorean eumetazoon and a volvocalean green alga. All classified sequences, together with their structures can be accessed at http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/bioinformatik/projects/ITS2.html. Furthermore, we found that, although sample sequences are known for most major taxa, there exists a profound divergence in coverage, which might become a hindrance for general usage. In summary, our analysis strengthens the potential of ITS2 as a general phylogenetic marker and provides a data source for further ITS2-based analyses.},

We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts. By comparing the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL, we identified polymorphic cis-acting stem cell genes. We also identified multiple trans-acting control loci that modify expression of large numbers of genes. These groups of coregulated transcripts identify pathways that specify variation in stem cells. We illustrate this concept with the identification of candidate genes involved with HSC turnover. We compared expression QTLs in HSCs and brain from the same mice and identified both shared and tissue-specific QTLs. Our data are accessible through WebQTL, a web-based interface that allows custom genetic linkage analysis and identification of coregulated transcripts.},

abstract = {A key goal of biomedical research is to elucidate the complex network of gene interactions underlying complex traits such as common human diseases. Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying and experimentally validating the involvement of three new genes in susceptibility to obesity.},

Thus, the technology needs to be available to many laboratories and open exchange of information is required such as those achieved for transcript and protein data. The key-step in metabolite profiling is the unambiguous identification of metabolites in highly complex metabolite preparations with composite structure. Collections of mass spectra, which comprise frequently observed identified and non-identified metabolites, represent the most effective means to pool the identification efforts currently performed in many laboratories around the world. Here, we describe a platform for mass spectral and retention time index libraries that will enable this process (MSRI; www.csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/gmd.html). This resource should ameliorate many of the problems that each laboratory will face both for the initial establishment of metabolome analysis and for its maintenance at a constant sample throughput.},

abstract = {Lignification and the complex relationships between lignins and polysaccharide or protein wall components are the basic cause of reduced digestibility in silage maize and other forage crops. Even if major genes of the lignin pathway are known in different species of forage plants, several QTL explaining a significant part of genetic variation either for lignin content or for cell wall digestibility in maize seem to have no colocalization with major genes of the lignin pathway, or their involvement is not yet entirely established. Cell wall and lignin contents, and cell wall digestibility, were thus investigated in an available Arabidopsis RIL progeny, using mature floral stems as organs representative of maize stalks and forage grass hays. Putative candidate genes underlying QTL were then looked for from genomic data available in Arabidopsis databases. Four QTL of cell wall digestibility were found on chromosomes 2, 4, and 5, but unlike previous observations in maize, these QTL were always associated with cell wall content QTL. Two QTL of lignin content in the cell wall were found on chromosome 3, without any colocalization with cell wall content or digestibility QTL. Only two putative candidate genes involved in the lignin monolignol pathway colocalized with found QTL. The PAL4 gene (At3g10340) and the CAD-C gene (At3g19450) positions were both located in the support interval of a QTL of KL/NDF on chromosome 3. However, laccases, peroxidases, and myb transcription factors were also found in the support interval of cell wall digestibility QTL. Genes involved in biosynthesis of polysaccharide and protein compounds of the cell wall were also found colocalizing with cell wall content QTL. The high differences between a floral stem of dicotyledons and a stalk of C4 monocotyledon, in anatomy, tissue patterning, lignin structure and specificity cross-linkage by hydroxycinnamic acids in grass cell walls could explain the difference observed between Arabidopsis and maize. However, the model plant Arabidopsis was proven as very efficient in evidencing genes of the lignin pathway from knocked-out genes, and such a RIL analysis should allow the evidencing of still unknown genes also involved in stem cell wall digestibility.},

abstract = {To reveal the transcriptomes of Arabidopsis seed, comprehensive expression analysis was performed using ATH1 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). In the dry seed, more than 12 000 stored mRNA species were detected, including all ontological categories. Statistical analysis revealed that promoters of highly expressed genes in wild-type dry seeds overrepresented abscisic acid-responsive elements (ABREs) containing the core motif ACGT. Although the coupling element and seed-specific enhancer RY motif alone were not prominently overrepresented in genes with high expression, the presence of these elements in combination with ABRE was associated with particularly high gene expression. The transcriptome of the imbibed seeds differed from that of the dry seed even at 6 h after seed imbibition. After imbibition many upregulated and downregulated genes were co-regulated in clusters of three to five genes. Genes for which expression was affected by the abi5 mutation tended to be located in clusters, suggesting that transactivation by ABI5 is not restricted to a single gene, but affects other proximal genes. Furthermore, cytosine methylation was observed not only in large silent retrotransposon clusters in centromeric regions, but also in non-centromeric silent gene clusters in the seed. These results suggest that such regions might be transcriptionally silenced by methylation or heterochromatin structures. Our analyses reveal that transcriptomes of Arabidopsis seed are characterized by multiple regulatory mechanisms: epigenetic chromatin structures, chromosomal locations (e.g. co-regulated gene clusters) and cis-acting elements.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to the importance of considering secondary structures in aligning functional RNAs, several pairwise sequence-structure alignment methods have been developed. They use extended alignment scores that evaluate secondary structure information in addition to sequence information. However, two problems for the multiple alignment step remain. First, how to combine pairwise sequence-structure alignments into a multiple alignment and second, how to generate secondary structure information for sequences whose explicit structural information is missing. RESULTS: We describe a novel approach for multiple alignment of RNAs (MARNA) taking into consideration both the primary and the secondary structures. It is based on pairwise sequence-structure comparisons of RNAs. From these sequence-structure alignments, libraries of weighted alignment edges are generated. The weights reflect the sequential and structural conservation. For sequences whose secondary structures are missing, the libraries are generated by sampling low energy conformations. The libraries are then processed by the T-Coffee system, which is a consistency based multiple alignment method. Furthermore, we are able to extract a consensus-sequence and -structure from a multiple alignment. We have successfully tested MARNA on several datasets taken from the Rfam database.},

abstract = {Temperature is a primary environmental cue for seed germination of many weeds and vegetables. To investigate the mechanism of germination regulation by temperature, we selected five high temperature (thermoinhibition)-resistant germination mutants (TRW lines) from 20,000 T-DNA insertion lines of Arabidopsis. Segregation analyses indicated that each of the five lines had single locus recessive mutations. The seeds of TRW134-15 and TRW187 showed reduced sensitivity to ABA and also to the gibberrellin biosynthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol. Genetic and nucleotide sequencing analyses indicated that TRW187 is a new allele of abi3 (abi3-14). TRW71-1 exhibited a maternal effect for both thermoinhibition-resistant and transparent testa phenotypes, and genetic analysis revealed that the mutation was allelic to tt7 (tt7-4 sib). Interestingly, the seeds of reduced dormancy mutants rdo1, rdo2, rdo3 and rdo4 were also thermoinhibition tolerant, and all the TRW seeds showed reduced dormancy. Like rdo3, TRW13-1 had shorter siliques and slightly shorter stems than the wild type. The mutation of TRW13-1 was mapped to the bottom arm of chromosome 1 where rdo3 has also been mapped, but the two mutants are not allelic. We designated TRW13-1 as thermoinhibition-resistant germination 1 (trg1). We also mapped the ABA-insensitive mutation of TRW134-15 to the bottom arm of chromosome 5 and named it trg2. These results show that both embryo/endosperm and maternal factors contribute to germination inhibition at supraoptimal temperatures in Arabidopsis. In addition, we confirm the role of ABA in thermoinhibition of seed germination and a link between seed physiological dormancy and response to high temperature.},

abstract = {The study of QTL x environment interaction (QEI) is important for understanding genotype x environment interaction (GEI) in many quantitative traits. For modeling GEI and QEI, factorial regression (FR) models form a powerful class of models. In FR models, covariables (contrasts) defined on the levels of the genotypic and/or environmental factor(s) are used to describe main effects and interactions. In FR models for QTL expression, considerable numbers of genotypic covariables can occur as for each putative QTL an additional covariable needs to be introduced. For large numbers of genotypic and/or environmental covariables, least square estimation breaks down and partial least squares (PLS) estimation procedures become an attractive alternative. In this paper we develop methodology for analyzing QEI by FR for estimating effects and locations of QTLs and QEI and interpreting QEI in terms of environmental variables. A randomization test for the main effects of QTLs and QEI is presented. A population of F2 derived F3 families was evaluated in eight environments differing in drought stress and soil nitrogen content and the traits yield and anthesis silking interval (ASI) were measured. For grain yield, chromosomes 1 and 10 showed significant QEI, whereas in chromosomes 3 and 8 only main effect QTLs were observed. For ASI, QTL main effects were observed on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10, whereas QEI was observed only on chromosome 8. The assessment of the QEI at chromosome 1 for grain yield showed that the QTL main effect explained 35.8\% of the QTL + QEI variability, while QEI explained 64.2\%. Minimum temperature during flowering time explained 77.6\% of the QEI. The QEI analysis at chromosome 10 showed that the QTL main effect explained 59.8\% of the QTL + QEI variability, while QEI explained 40.2\%. Maximum temperature during flowering time explained 23.8\% of the QEI. Results of this study show the possibilities of using FR for mapping QTL and for dissecting QEI in terms of environmental variables. PLS regression is efficient in accounting for background noise produced by other QTLs.},

abstract = {Seed dormancy is an innate seed property that defines the environmental conditions in which the seed is able to germinate. It is determined by genetics with a substantial environmental influence which is mediated, at least in part, by the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins. Not only is the dormancy status influenced by the seed maturation environment, it is also continuously changing with time following shedding in a manner determined by the ambient environment. As dormancy is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions, adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment. Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that adaptation has taken place on a theme rather than via fundamentally different paths and identify similarities underlying the extensive diversity in the dormancy response to the environment that controls germination.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) has been extensively studied in mammalian systems but much less in plants. Here we report AS events deduced from EST/cDNA analysis in two model plants: Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, 4,707 (21.8\%) of the genes with EST/cDNA evidence show 8,264 AS events. Approximately 56\% of these events are intron retention (IntronR), and only 8\% are exon skipping. In rice, 6,568 (21.2\%) of the expressed genes display 14,542 AS events, of which 53.5\% are IntronR and 13.8\% are exon skipping. The consistent high frequency of IntronR suggests prevalence of splice site recognition by intron definition in plants. Different AS events within a given gene occur, for the most part, independently. In total, 36-43\% of the AS events produce transcripts that would be targets of the non-sense-mediated decay pathway, if that pathway were to operate in plants as in humans. Forty percent of Arabidopsis AS genes are alternatively spliced also in rice, with some examples strongly suggesting a role of the AS event as an evolutionary conserved mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. We created a comprehensive web-interfaced database to compile and visualize the evidence for alternative splicing in plants (Alternative Splicing in Plants, available at www.plantgdb.org/ASIP).},

The hydrolysis products have many different biological activities, e.g., as defense compounds and attractants. For humans these compounds function as cancer-preventing agents, biopesticides, and flavor compounds. Since the completion of the Arabidopsis genome, glucosinolate research has made significant progress, resulting in near-complete elucidation of the core biosynthetic pathway, identification of the first regulators of the pathway, metabolic engineering of specific glucosinolate profiles to study function, as well as identification of evolutionary links to related pathways. Although much has been learned in recent years, much more awaits discovery before we fully understand how and why plants synthesize glucosinolates.

abstract = {The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in a form that allows it to be integrated with other data. One approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

@article{Reymond:2006,
abstract = {One of the responses of plants to low sources of external phosphorus (P) is to modify root architecture. In Arabidopsis thaliana plantlets grown on low P, the primary root length (PRL) is reduced whereas lateral root growth is promoted. By using the Bay-0 x Shahdara recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, we have mapped three quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in the root growth response to low P. The Shahdara alleles at these three QTL promote the response of the primary root to low P (i.e., root length reduction). One of these QTL, LPR1, located in a 2.8 Mb region at the top of chromosome 1, explains 52\% of the variance of the PRL. We also detected a single QTL associated with primary root cell elongation in response to low P which colocalizes with LPR1. LPR1 does not seem to be involved in other typical P-starvation responses such as growth and density of root hairs, excretion of acid phosphatases, anthocyanin accumulation or the transcriptional induction of the P transporter Phtl;4. LPR1 might highlight new aspects of root growth that are revealed specifically under low P conditions.},

We show that it is possible to infer the magnitude and direction of causal relationships among multiple correlated phenotypes and illustrate the technique using body composition and bone density data from mouse intercross populations. Using these techniques we are able to distinguish genetic loci that affect adiposity from those that affect overall body size and thus reveal a shortcoming of standardized measures such as body mass index that are widely used in obesity research. The identification of causal networks sheds light on the nature of genetic heterogeneity and pleiotropy in complex genetic systems.},

We consider the prominent problem of reconstructing the basal phylogenetic tree topology when several subclades have already been identified or are well known by other means, such as morphological characteristics. Whereas most available tools attempt to estimate a fully resolved tree from scratch, the profile neighbor-joining (PNJ) method focuses directly on the mentioned problem and has proven a robust and efficient method for large-scale data sets, especially when used in an iterative way. We describe an implementation of this idea, the ProfDist software package, which is freely available, and apply the method to estimate the phylogeny of the eukaryotes. Overall, the PNJ approach provides a novel effective way to mine large sequence datasets for relevant phylogenetic information.},

abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is a phylogenetic marker which has been of broad use in generic and infrageneric level classifications, as its sequence evolves comparably fast. Only recently, it became clear, that the ITS2 might be useful even for higher level systematic analyses. As the secondary structure is highly conserved within all eukaryotes it serves as a valuable template for the construction of highly reliable sequence-structure alignments, which build a fundament for subsequent analyses. Thus, any phylogenetic study using ITS2 has to consider both sequence and structure. We have integrated a homology based RNA structure prediction algorithm into a web server, which allows the detection and secondary structure prediction for ITS2 in any given sequence. Furthermore, the resource contains more than 25,000 pre-calculated secondary structures for the currently known ITS2 sequences. These can be taxonomically searched and browsed. Thus, our resource could become a starting point for ITS2-based phylogenetic analyses and is therefore complementary to databases of other phylogenetic markers, which focus on higher level analyses. The current version of the ITS2 database can be accessed via http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.},

@article{Diaz:2006,
abstract = {For the first time in Arabidopsis thaliana, this work proposes the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with leaf senescence and stress response symptoms such as yellowing and anthocyanin-associated redness. When Arabidopsis plants were cultivated under low nitrogen conditions, we observed that both yellowing of the old leaves of the rosette and whole rosette redness were promoted. Leaf yellowing is a senescence symptom related to chlorophyll breakdown. Redness is a symptom of anthocyanin accumulation related to whole plant ageing and nutrient limitation. In this work, Arabidopsis is used as a model system to dissect the genetic variation of these parameters by QTL mapping in the 415 recombinant inbred lines of the Bay-0xShahdara population. Fifteen new QTLs and two epistatic interactions were described in this study. The yellowing of the rosette, estimated by visual notation and image processing, was controlled by four and five QTLs, respectively. The visual estimation of redness allowed us to detect six QTLs among which the major one explained 33\% of the total variation. Two main QTLs were confirmed in near-isogenic lines (heterogenous inbred family; HIF), thus confirming the relevance of the visual notation of these traits. Co-localizations between QTLs for leaf yellowing, redness and nitrogen use efficiency described in a previous publication indicate complex interconnected pathways involved in both nitrogen management and senescence- and stress-related processes. No co-localization between QTLs for leaf yellowing and redness has been found, suggesting that the two characters are genetically independent.},

abstract = {Besides being a metabolic fuel, carbohydrates play important roles in plant growth and development, in stress responses, and as signal molecules. We exploited natural variation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to decipher the genetic architecture determining carbohydrate content. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach in the Bay-0 x Shahdara progeny grown in two contrasting nitrogen environments led to the identification of 39 QTLs for starch, glucose, fructose, and sucrose contents representing at least 14 distinct polymorphic loci. A major QTL for fructose content (FR3.4) and a QTL for starch content (ST3.4) were confirmed in heterogeneous inbred families. Several genes associated with carbon (C) metabolism colocalize with the identified QTL. QTLs for senescence-related traits, and for flowering time, water status, and nitrogen-related traits, previously detected with the same genetic material, colocalize with C-related QTLs. These colocalizations reflect the complex interactions of C metabolism with other physiological processes. QTL fine-mapping and cloning could thus lead soon to the identification of genes potentially involved in the control of different connected physiological processes.},

abstract = {While the metabolic networks in developing seeds during the period of reserve accumulation have been extensively characterized, much less is known about those present during seed desiccation and subsequent germination. Here we utilized metabolite profiling, in conjunction with selective mRNA and physiological profiling to characterize Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds throughout development and germination. Seed maturation was associated with a significant reduction of most sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, suggesting their efficient incorporation into storage reserves. The transition from reserve accumulation to seed desiccation was associated with a major metabolic switch, resulting in the accumulation of distinct sugars, organic acids, nitrogen-rich amino acids, and shikimate-derived metabolites. In contrast, seed vernalization was associated with a decrease in the content of several of the metabolic intermediates accumulated during seed desiccation, implying that these intermediates might support the metabolic reorganization needed for seed germination. Concomitantly, the levels of other metabolites significantly increased during vernalization and were boosted further during germination sensu stricto, implying their importance for germination and seedling establishment. The metabolic switches during seed maturation and germination were also associated with distinct patterns of expression of genes encoding metabolism-associated gene products, as determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and analysis of publicly available microarray data. When taken together our results provide a comprehensive picture of the coordinated changes in primary metabolism that underlie seed development and germination in Arabidopsis. They furthermore imply that the metabolic preparation for germination and efficient seedling establishment initiates already during seed desiccation and continues by additional distinct metabolic switches during vernalization and early germination.},

Instead of focusing on specific metabolites, we have applied empirical untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS). This uncovered many qualitative and quantitative differences in metabolite accumulation between A. thaliana accessions. Only 13.4\% of the mass peaks were detected in all 14 accessions analyzed. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of more than 2,000 mass peaks, detected in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the two most divergent accessions, enabled the identification of QTLs for about 75\% of the mass signals. More than one-third of the signals were not detected in either parent, indicating the large potential for modification of metabolic composition through classical breeding.},

abstract = {Whether in natural populations or between two unrelated members of a species, most phenotypic variation is quantitative. To analyze such quantitative traits, one must first map the underlying quantitative trait loci. Next, and far more difficult, one must identify the quantitative trait genes (QTGs), characterize QTG interactions, and identify the phenotypically relevant polymorphisms to determine how QTGs contribute to phenotype. In this work, we analyzed three Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-temperature growth (Htg) QTGs (MKT1, END3, and RHO2). We observed a high level of genetic interactions among QTGs and strain background. Interestingly, while the MKT1 and END3 coding polymorphisms contribute to phenotype, it is the RHO2 3'UTR polymorphisms that are phenotypically relevant. Reciprocal hemizygosity analysis of the Htg QTGs in hybrids between S288c and ten unrelated S. cerevisiae strains reveals that the contributions of the Htg QTGs are not conserved in nine other hybrids, which has implications for QTG identification by marker-trait association. Our findings demonstrate the variety and complexity of QTG contributions to phenotype, the impact of genetic background, and the value of quantitative genetic studies in S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Different types of AS have been observed; these include exon skipping, alternative donor or acceptor site and intron retention. In humans, exon skipping is the most common type while intron retention is rare. In contrast, in Arabidopsis, intron retention is the most prevalent AS type (approximately 40\%). Here we show that direct transcript expression analysis using high-density oligonucleotide-based whole-genome microarrays (WGAs) is particularly amenable for assessing global intron retention in Arabidopsis. By applying a novel algorithm retained introns are detected in 8\% of the transcripts examined. A sampling of 14 transcripts showed that 86\% can be confirmed by RT-PCR. This rate of detection predicts an overall total AS rate of 20\% for Arabidopsis compared with 10-22\% based on EST/cDNA-based analysis. These findings will facilitate monitoring constitutive and dynamic whole-genome splicing on the next generation WGA slides.},

abstract = {Recent genetical genomics studies have provided intimate views on gene regulatory networks. Gene expression variations between genetically different individuals have been mapped to the causal regulatory regions, termed expression quantitative trait loci. Whether the environment-induced plastic response of gene expression also shows heritable difference has not yet been studied. Here we show that differential expression induced by temperatures of 16 degrees C and 24 degrees C has a strong genetic component in Caenorhabditis elegans recombinant inbred strains derived from a cross between strains CB4856 (Hawaii) and N2 (Bristol). No less than 59\% of 308 trans-acting genes showed a significant eQTL-by-environment interaction, here termed plasticity quantitative trait loci. In contrast, only 8\% of an estimated 188 cis-acting genes showed such interaction. This indicates that heritable differences in plastic responses of gene expression are largely regulated in trans. This regulation is spread over many different regulators. However, for one group of trans-genes we found prominent evidence for a common master regulator: a transband of 66 coregulated genes appeared at 24 degrees C. Our results suggest widespread genetic variation of differential expression responses to environmental impacts and demonstrate the potential of genetical genomics for mapping the molecular determinants of phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {Expression microarrays hybridized with RNA can simultaneously provide both phenotypic (gene expression) and genotypic (marker) data. We developed two types of genetic markers from Affymetrix GeneChip expression data to generate detailed haplotypes for 148 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Bayreuth and Shahdara. Gene expression markers (GEMs) are based on differences in transcript levels that exhibit bimodal distributions in segregating progeny, while single feature polymorphism (SFP) markers rely on differences in hybridization to individual oligonucleotide probes. Unlike SFPs, GEMs can be derived from any type of DNA-based expression microarray. Our method identifies SFPs independent of a gene's expression level. Alleles for each GEM and SFP marker were ascertained with GeneChip data from parental accessions as well as RILs; a novel algorithm for allele determination using RIL distributions capitalized on the high level of genetic replication per locus. GEMs and SFP markers provided robust markers in 187 and 968 genes, respectively, which allowed estimation of gene order consistent with that predicted from the Col-0 genomic sequence. Using microarrays on a population to simultaneously measure gene expression variation and obtain genotypic data for a linkage map will facilitate expression QTL analyses without the need for separate genotyping. We have demonstrated that gene expression measurements from microarrays can be leveraged to identify polymorphisms across the genome and can be efficiently developed into genetic markers that are verifiable in a large segregating RIL population. Both marker types also offer opportunities for massively parallel mapping in unsequenced and less studied species.},

@article{Seibel2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the fundament of all proceeding analyses. Errors in an alignment could strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could lead to wrong predictions. Hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are necessary and meanwhile good common practice. For RNA sequences often the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-RNA. Recently, some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and model both kinds of information. However, with the advent of a large amount of reliable RNA sequences together with their solved secondary structures (available from e.g. the ITS2 Database), we are faced with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary structures synchronously. RESULTS: 4SALE fills this gap. The application allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing of aligned sequences and their secondary structures. This study describes an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4SALE used for further analyses and editing. 4SALE builds an optimal and unique starting point for every RNA sequence and structure analysis. CONCLUSION: 4SALE, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for RNA analysis based on sequence and secondary structure information. The program connects sequence and structure databases like the ITS2 Database to phylogeny programs as for example the CBCAnalyzer. 4SALE is written in JAVA and therefore platform independent. The software is freely available and distributed from the website at http://4sale.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.},

abstract = {The Arabidopsis thaliana accession Shahdara was identified as a rare naturally occurring mutant that does not liberate seed mucilage on imbibition. The defective locus was found to be allelic to the mum2-1 and mum2-2 mutants. Map-based cloning showed that MUCILAGE-MODIFIED2 (MUM2) encodes the putative beta-D-galactosidase BGAL6. Activity assays demonstrated that one of four major beta-D-galactosidase activities present in developing siliques is absent in mum2 mutants. No difference was observed in seed coat epidermal cell structure between wild-type and mutant seed; however, weakening of the outer tangential cell wall by chemical treatment resulted in the release of mucilage from mum2 seed coat epidermal cells, and the mum2 mucilage only increased slightly in volume, relative to the wild type. Consistent with the absence of beta-D-galactosidase activity in the mutant, the inner layer of mucilage contained more Gal. The allocation of polysaccharides between the inner and outer mucilage layers was also modified in mum2. Mass spectrometry showed that rhamnogalacturonan I in mutant mucilage had more branching between rhamnose and hexose residues relative to the wild type. We conclude that the MUM2/BGAL6 beta-D-galactosidase is required for maturation of rhamnogalacturonan I in seed mucilage by the removal of galactose/galactan branches, resulting in increased swelling and extrusion of the mucilage on seed hydration.},

@article{Schadt:2007,
abstract = {To dissect common human diseases such as obesity and diabetes, a systematic approach is needed to study how genes interact with one another, and with genetic and environmental factors, to determine clinical end points or disease phenotypes. Bayesian networks provide a convenient framework for extracting relationships from noisy data and are frequently applied to large-scale data to derive causal relationships among variables of interest. Given the complexity of molecular networks underlying common human disease traits, and the fact that biological networks can change depending on environmental conditions and genetic factors, large datasets, generally involving multiple perturbations (experiments), are required to reconstruct and reliably extract information from these networks. With limited resources, the balance of coverage of multiple perturbations and multiple subjects in a single perturbation needs to be considered in the experimental design. Increasing the number of experiments, or the number of subjects in an experiment, is an expensive and time-consuming way to improve network reconstruction. Integrating multiple types of data from existing subjects might be more efficient. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that combining genotypic and gene expression data in a segregating population leads to improved network reconstruction, which in turn may lead to better predictions of the effects of experimental perturbations on any given gene. Here we simulate data based on networks reconstructed from biological data collected in a segregating mouse population and quantify the improvement in network reconstruction achieved using genotypic and gene expression data, compared with reconstruction using gene expression data alone. We demonstrate that networks reconstructed using the combined genotypic and gene expression data achieve a level of reconstruction accuracy that exceeds networks reconstructed from expression data alone, and that fewer subjects may be required to achieve this superior reconstruction accuracy. We conclude that this integrative genomics approach to reconstructing networks not only leads to more predictive network models, but also may save time and money by decreasing the amount of data that must be generated under any given condition of interest to construct predictive network models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of functional non-coding RNA sequences has led to an increasing interest in algorithms related to RNA analysis. Traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing reliable alignments of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation of RNA sequences largely determines their function, and therefore RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural information into account. RESULTS: We present a graph-based representation for sequence-structure alignments, which we model as an integer linear program (ILP). We sketch how we compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the ILP using methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results on a recently published benchmark set for RNA alignments. CONCLUSION: The implementation of our algorithm yields better alignments in terms of two published scores than the other programs that we tested: This is especially the case with an increasing number of input sequences.

The genetic determinants of transcript-level variation were characterized in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (n = 211) of Arabidopsis thaliana using whole-genome microarray analysis and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping of transcript levels as expression traits (e-traits). Genetic control of transcription was highly complex: one-third of the quantitatively controlled transcripts/e-traits were regulated by cis-eQTL, and many trans-eQTL mapped to hotspots that regulated hundreds to thousands of e-traits. Several thousand eQTL of large phenotypic effect were detected, but almost all (93\%) of the 36,871 eQTL were associated with small phenotypic effects (R(2) < 0.3). Many transcripts/e-traits were controlled by multiple eQTL with opposite allelic effects and exhibited higher heritability in the RILs than their parents, suggesting nonadditive genetic variation. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale global eQTL study in a relatively large plant mapping population. It reveals that the genetic control of transcript level is highly variable and multifaceted and that this complexity may be a general characteristic of eukaryotes.},

Local eQTLs, where expression phenotypes map to the genes themselves, are of especially great interest, because they are direct candidates for previously mapped physiological QTLs. Here we show that many mapped local eQTLs in genetical genomics experiments do not reflect actual expression differences caused by sequence polymorphisms in cis-acting factors changing mRNA levels. Instead they indicate hybridization differences caused by sequence polymorphisms in the mRNA region that is targeted by the microarray probes. Many such polymorphisms can be detected by a sensitive and novel statistical approach that takes the individual probe signals into account. Applying this approach to recent mouse and human eQTL data, we demonstrate that indeed many local eQTLs are falsely reported as "cis-acting" or "cis" and can be successfully detected and eliminated with this approach.},

abstract = {Methylation at position 5 of cytosine in DNA plays a major role in epigenetic gene control. The methylation analysis can be performed by bisulfite genomic sequencing. Conventional procedures in this analysis include a treatment of single stranded DNA with 3-5 M sodium bisulfite at pH 5 and at 50-55 degrees for 4-20 hr. This will convert cytosine into uracil, while 5-methylcytosine resists this deamination. Amplification by PCR of the bisulfite-treated DNA followed by sequencing reveals the positions of 5-methylcytosine in the gene. We reported recently that the whole procedure can be speeded up by use of a highly concentrated bisulfite solution, 10 M ammonium bisulfite. We also reported that urea, which has been often added to the reaction mixture with the purpose of facilitating the reaction, may not work as anticipated. This time, we would like to address the need for further investigating the chemistry of the bisulfite modification of DNA. Particularly important is to study side reactions that may occur due to the exhaustive bisulfite treatment required for achieving complete deamination of all the cytosine residues in a given sample of DNA.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity and genotype-environment interactions (GEI) play an important role in the evolution of life histories. Knowledge of the molecular genetic basis of plasticity and GEI provides insight into the underlying mechanisms of life-history changes in different environments. We used a genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphism map in a recombinant N2 x CB4856 inbred panel of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study the genetic control of phenotypic plasticity to temperature in four fitness-related traits, that is, age at maturity, fertility, egg size and growth rate. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the respective traits at 12 and 24 degrees C, as well as their plasticities. We found genetic variation and GEI for age at maturity, fertility, egg size and growth rate. GEI in fertility and egg size was attributed to changes in rank order of reaction norms. In case of age at maturity and growth rate, GEI was caused mainly by differences in the among-line variance. In total, 11 QTLs were detected, five QTL at 12 degrees C and six QTL at 24 degrees C, which were associated with life-history traits. Five QTL associated with age at maturity, fertility and growth rate showed QTL x environment interaction. These colocalized with plasticity QTL for the respective traits suggesting allelic sensitivity to temperature. Further fine mapping, complementation analyses and gene silencing are planned to identify candidate genes underlying phenotypic plasticity for age at maturity, fertility and growth.},

Combining genetic and biochemical results and using a candidate gene approach, we have cloned the underlying gene, showing how a single-amino acid substitution in a key enzyme of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway, adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase, is responsible for a decrease in enzyme activity, leading to sulfate accumulation in the plant. This work illustrates the potential of natural variation as a source of new alleles of known genes, which can aid in the study of gene function and metabolic pathway regulation. Our new insights on sulfate assimilation may have an impact on sulfur fertilizer use and stress defense improvement.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {Primary transcripts (precursor-mRNAs) with introns can undergo alternative splicing to produce multiple transcripts from a single gene by differential use of splice sites, thereby increasing the transcriptome and proteome complexity within and between cells and tissues. Alternative splicing in plants is largely an unexplored area of gene expression, as this phenomenon used to be considered rare. However, recent genome-wide computational analyses have revealed that alternative splicing in flowering plants is far more prevalent than previously thought. Interestingly, pre-mRNAs of many spliceosomal proteins, especially serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, are extensively alternatively spliced. Furthermore, stresses have a dramatic effect on alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs including those that encode many spliceosomal proteins. Although the mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing in plants are largely unknown, several reports strongly suggest a key role for SR proteins in spliceosome assembly and regulated splicing. Recent studies suggest that alternative splicing in plants is an important posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism in modulating gene expression and eventually plant form and function.},

abstract = {Phenotypic variation between individuals of a species is often under quantitative genetic control. Genomic analysis of gene expression polymorphisms between individuals is rapidly gaining popularity as a way to query the underlying mechanistic causes of variation between individuals. However, there is little direct evidence of a linkage between global gene expression polymorphisms and phenotypic consequences. In this report, we have mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs)-controlling glucosinolate content in a population of 403 Arabidopsis Bay x Sha recombinant inbred lines, 211 of which were previously used to identify expression QTLs controlling the transcript levels of biosynthetic genes. In a comparative study, we have directly tested two plant biosynthetic pathways for association between polymorphisms controlling biosynthetic gene transcripts and the resulting metabolites within the Arabidopsis Bay x Sha recombinant inbred line population. In this analysis, all loci controlling expression variation also affected the accumulation of the resulting metabolites. In addition, epistasis was detected more frequently for metabolic traits compared to transcript traits, even when both traits showed similar distributions. An analysis of candidate genes for QTL-controlling networks of transcripts and metabolites suggested that the controlling factors are a mix of enzymes and regulatory factors. This analysis showed that regulatory connections can feedback from metabolism to transcripts. Surprisingly, the most likely major regulator of both transcript level for nearly the entire pathway and aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation is variation in the last enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, AOP2. This suggests that natural variation in transcripts may significantly impact phenotypic variation, but that natural variation in metabolites or their enzymatic loci can feed back to affect the transcripts.},

The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

We used a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach based on a genetic map with evenly spaced single nucleotide polymorphism markers in an N2 x CB4856 recombinant inbred panel. Significant genetic correlations between various traits were found at both temperatures. We detected pleiotropic or closely linked QTL, which supported the negative correlation between egg size and egg number at 12 degrees C, the positive correlation across temperatures for body mass, and the positive correlation between body mass and egg size at 12 degrees C. The results indicate that specific loci control the covariation in these life-history traits and the locus control is prone to environmental conditions.},

For many genes, variation in expression could be explained by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The nature and consequences of this variation are discussed based on additional genetic parameters, such as heritability and transgression and by examining the genomic position of eQTLs versus gene position, polymorphism frequency, and gene ontology. Furthermore, we developed an approach for genetic regulatory network construction by combining eQTL mapping and regulator candidate gene selection. The power of our method was shown in a case study of genes associated with flowering time, a well studied regulatory network in Arabidopsis. Results that revealed clusters of coregulated genes and their most likely regulators were in agreement with published data, and unknown relationships could be predicted.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that nicotinamide must be degraded during germination; however, the enzyme responsible and its physiological role have not been previously studied. We have identified an Arabidopsis gene, NIC2, that is expressed at relatively high levels in mature seed, and encodes a nicotinamidase enzyme with homology to yeast and bacterial nicotinamidases. Seed of a knockout mutant, nic2-1, had reduced nicotinamidase activity, retarded germination and impaired germination potential. nic2-1 germination was restored by after-ripening or moist chilling, but remained hypersensitive to application of nicotinamide or ABA. Nicotinamide is a known inhibitor of NAD-degrading poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP enzymes) that are implicated in DNA repair. We found reduced poly(ADP)ribosylation levels in nic2-1 seed, which were restored by moist chilling. Furthermore, nic2-1 seed had elevated levels of NAD, and germination was hypersensitive to methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), suggesting that PARP activity and DNA repair responses were impaired. We suggest that nicotinamide is normally metabolized by NIC2 during moist chilling or after-ripening, which relieves inhibition of PARP activity and allows DNA repair to occur prior to germination.},

abstract = {Progress in systems biology is seriously hindered by slow production of suitable software infrastructures. Biologists need infrastructure that easily connects to work that is done in other laboratories, for which standardization is helpful. However, the infrastructure must also accommodate the specifics of their biological system, but appropriate mechanisms to support variation are currently lacking. We argue that a minimal computer language, and a software tool called a generator, can be used to quickly produce customized software infrastructures that 'systems biologists really want to have'.},

abstract = {We here describe the MetaNetwork protocol to reconstruct metabolic networks using metabolite abundance data from segregating populations. MetaNetwork maps metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) underlying variation in metabolite abundance in individuals of a segregating population using a two-part model to account for the often observed spike in the distribution of metabolite abundance data. MetaNetwork predicts and visualizes potential associations between metabolites using correlations of mQTL profiles, rather than of abundance profiles. Simulation and permutation procedures are used to assess statistical significance. Analysis of about 20 metabolite mass peaks from a mass spectrometer takes a few minutes on a desktop computer. Analysis of 2,000 mass peaks will take up to 4 days. In addition, MetaNetwork is able to integrate high-throughput data from subsequent metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics experiments in conjunction with traditional phenotypic data. This way MetaNetwork will contribute to a better integration of such data into systems biology.},

@article{Bhave:2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the advent of "omics" (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and phenomics), studies can produce enormous amounts of data. Managing this diverse data and integrating with other biological data are major challenges for the bioinformatics community. Comprehensive new tools are needed to store, integrate and analyze the data efficiently. DESCRIPTION: The PhenoGen Informatics website http://phenogen.uchsc.edu is a comprehensive toolbox for storing, analyzing and integrating microarray data and related genotype and phenotype data. The site is particularly suited for combining QTL and microarray data to search for "candidate" genes contributing to complex traits. In addition, the site allows, if desired by the investigators, sharing of the data. Investigators can conduct "in-silico" microarray experiments using their own and/or "shared" data. CONCLUSION: The PhenoGen website provides access to tools that can be used for high-throughput data storage, analyses and interpretation of the results. Some of the advantages of the architecture of the website are that, in the future, the present set of tools can be adapted for the analyses of any type of high-throughput "omics" data, and that access to new tools, available in the public domain or developed at PhenoGen, can be easily provided.},

@article{Grajales2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused on primary DNA sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures are particularly useful in systematics because they include characteristics, not found in the primary sequence, that give "morphological" information. Despite the number of recent molecular studies on octocorals, there is no consensus opinion about a region that carries enough phylogenetic resolution to solve intrageneric or close species relationships. Moreover, intrageneric morphological information by itself does not always produce accurate phylogenies; intra-species comparisons can reveal greater differences than intra-generic ones. The search for new phylogenetic approaches, such as by RNA secondary structure analysis, is therefore a priority in octocoral research. RESULTS: Initially, twelve predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed to provide the basic information for phylogenetic analyses; they accorded with the 6 helicoidal ring model, also present in other groups of corals and eukaryotes. We obtained three similar topologies for nine species of the Caribbean gorgonian genus Eunicea (candelabrum corals) with two sister taxa as outgroups (genera Plexaura and Pseudoplexaura) on the basis of molecular morphometrics of ITS2 RNA secondary structures only, traditional primary sequence analyses and maximum likelihood, and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach allowed us to include both primary sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics; each data partition was allowed to have a different evolution rate. In addition, each helix was partitioned as if it had evolved at a distinct rate. Plexaura flexuosa was found to group within Eunicea; this was best supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined analyses. We suggest Eunicea flexuosa (Lamouroux, 1821) comb. nov., and we present a new species description including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of morphological characteristics (sclerites). Eunicea flexuosa, E. pallida, E. laxispica and E. mammosa formed a separate clade in the molecular phylogenies, and were reciprocally monophyletic with respect to other Eunicea (Euniceopsis subgenus, e.g. E. tourneforti and E. laciniata) in the molecular morphometrics tree, with the exception of E. fusca. Moreover, we suggest a new diagnostic character for Eunicea, also present in E. flexuosa: middle layer sclerites > 1 mm in length. CONCLUSION: ITS2 was a reliable sequence for intrageneric studies in gorgonian octocorals because of the amount of phylogenetic signal, and was corroborated against morphological characters separating Eunicea from Plexaura. The ITS2 RNA secondary structure approach to phylogeny presented here did not rely on alignment methods such as INDELS, but provided clearly homologous characters for partition analysis and RNA molecular morphometrics. These approaches support the divergence of Eunicea flexuosa comb. nov. from the outgroup Plexaura, although it has been considered part of this outgroup for nearly two centuries because of morphological resemblance.},

abstract = {Complex quantitative traits of plants as measured on collections of genotypes across multiple environments are the outcome of processes that depend in intricate ways on genotype and environment simultaneously. For a better understanding of the genetic architecture of such traits as observed across environments, genotype-by-environment interaction should be modeled with statistical models that use explicit information on genotypes and environments. The modeling approach we propose explains genotype-by-environment interaction by differential quantitative trait locus (QTL) expression in relation to environmental variables. We analyzed grain yield and grain moisture for an experimental data set composed of 976 F(5) maize testcross progenies evaluated across 12 environments in the U.S. corn belt during 1994 and 1995. The strategy we used was based on mixed models and started with a phenotypic analysis of multi-environment data, modeling genotype-by-environment interactions and associated genetic correlations between environments, while taking into account intraenvironmental error structures. The phenotypic mixed models were then extended to QTL models via the incorporation of marker information as genotypic covariables. A majority of the detected QTL showed significant QTL-by-environment interactions (QEI). The QEI were further analyzed by including environmental covariates into the mixed model. Most QEI could be understood as differential QTL expression conditional on longitude or year, both consequences of temperature differences during critical stages of the growth.},

@article{Dowdle:2007,
abstract = {Plants synthesize ascorbate from guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-mannose via L-galactose/L-gulose, although uronic acids have also been proposed as precursors. Genes encoding all the enzymes of the GDP-mannose pathway have previously been identified, with the exception of the step that converts GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose 1-P. We show that a GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase, encoded by the Arabidopsis thaliana VTC2 gene, catalyses this step in the ascorbate biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, a homologue of VTC2, At5g55120, encodes a second GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase with similar properties to VTC2. Two At5g55120 T-DNA insertion mutants (vtc5-1 and vtc5-2) have 80\% of the wild-type ascorbate level. Double mutants were produced by crossing the loss-of-function vtc2-1 mutant with each of the two vtc5 alleles. These show growth arrest immediately upon germination and the cotyledons subsequently bleach. Normal growth was restored by supplementation with ascorbate or L-galactose, indicating that both enzymes are necessary for ascorbate generation. vtc2-1 leaves contain more mannose 6-P than wild-type. We conclude that the GDP-mannose pathway is the only significant source of ascorbate in A. thaliana seedlings, and that ascorbate is essential for seedling growth. A. thaliana leaves accumulate more ascorbate after acclimatization to high light intensity. VTC2 expression and GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase activity rapidly increase on transfer to high light, but the activity of other enzymes in the GDP-mannose pathway is little affected. VTC2 and At5g55120 (VTC5) expression also peak in at the beginning of the light cycle and are controlled by the circadian clock. The GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase step may therefore play an important role in controlling ascorbate biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Ectotherms rely for their body heat on surrounding temperatures. A key question in biology is why most ectotherms mature at a larger size at lower temperatures, a phenomenon known as the temperature-size rule. Since temperature affects virtually all processes in a living organism, current theories to explain this phenomenon are diverse and complex and assert often from opposing assumptions. Although widely studied, the molecular genetic control of the temperature-size rule is unknown. We found that the Caenorhabditis elegans wild-type N2 complied with the temperature-size rule, whereas wild-type CB4856 defied it. Using a candidate gene approach based on an N2 x CB4856 recombinant inbred panel in combination with mutant analysis, complementation, and transgenic studies, we show that a single nucleotide polymorphism in tra-3 leads to mutation F96L in the encoded calpain-like protease. This mutation attenuates the ability of CB4856 to grow larger at low temperature. Homology modelling predicts that F96L reduces TRA-3 activity by destabilizing the DII-A domain. The data show that size adaptation of ectotherms to temperature changes may be less complex than previously thought because a subtle wild-type polymorphism modulates the temperature responsiveness of body size. These findings provide a novel step toward the molecular understanding of the temperature-size rule, which has puzzled biologists for decades.},

Whereas a correct formulation of the problem leads to a single exact null distribution, these GO tools use a large variety of statistical tests whose denominations often do not clarify the underlying P-value computations. SUMMARY: We review the different formulations of the problem and the tests they lead to: the binomial, chi2, equality of two probabilities, Fisher's exact and hypergeometric tests. We clarify the relationships existing between these tests, in particular the equivalence between the hypergeometric test and Fisher's exact test. We recall that the other tests are valid only for large samples, the test of equality of two probabilities and the chi2-test being equivalent. We discuss the appropriateness of one- and two-sided P-values, as well as some discreteness and conservatism issues.

abstract = {In Arabidopsis recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations are widely used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. However, mapping analyses with this type of population can be limited because of the masking effects of major QTL and epistatic interactions of multiple QTL. An alternative type of immortal experimental population commonly used in plant species are sets of introgression lines. Here we introduce the development of a genomewide coverage near-isogenic line (NIL) population of Arabidopsis thaliana, by introgressing genomic regions from the Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) accession into the Landsberg erecta (Ler) genetic background. We have empirically compared the QTL mapping power of this new population with an already existing RIL population derived from the same parents. For that, we analyzed and mapped QTL affecting six developmental traits with different heritability. Overall, in the NIL population smaller-effect QTL than in the RIL population could be detected although the localization resolution was lower. Furthermore, we estimated the effect of population size and of the number of replicates on the detection power of QTL affecting the developmental traits. In general, population size is more important than the number of replicates to increase the mapping power of RILs, whereas for NILs several replicates are absolutely required. These analyses are expected to facilitate experimental design for QTL mapping using these two common types of segregating populations.},

abstract = {Growth in plants is modulated by a complex interplay between internal signals and external cues. Although traditional mutagenesis has been a successful approach for the identification of growth regulatory genes, it is likely that many genes involved in growth control remain to be discovered. In this study, we used the phenotypic variation between Bay-0 and Shahdara, two natural strains (accessions) of Arabidopsis thaliana, to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting light- and temperature-regulated growth of the embryonic stem (hypocotyl). Using heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs), the gene underlying one QTL, LIGHT5, was identified as a tandem zinc knuckle/PLU3 domain encoding gene (At5g43630; TZP), which carries a premature stop codon in Bay-0. Hypocotyl growth assays in monochromatic light and microarray analysis demonstrate that TZP controls blue light associated growth in a time-of-day fashion by regulating genes involved in growth, such as peroxidase and cell wall synthesis genes. TZP expression is phased by the circadian clock and light/dark cycles to the beginning of the day, the time of maximal growth in A. thaliana in short-day conditions. Based on its domain structure and localization in the nucleus, we propose that TZP acts downstream of the circadian clock and photoreceptor signaling pathways to directly control genes responsible for growth. The identification of TZP thus provides new insight into how daily synchronization of growth pathways plays a critical role in growth regulation.},

To identify additional risk variants, we genotyped 1,020 of the most strongly associated non-HLA markers in an additional 1,643 cases and 3,406 controls. Through joint analysis including the genome-wide association study data (767 cases, 1,422 controls), we identified seven previously unknown risk regions (P < 5 x 10(-7)). Six regions harbor genes controlling immune responses, including CCR3, IL12A, IL18RAP, RGS1, SH2B3 (nsSNP rs3184504) and TAGAP. Whole-blood IL18RAP mRNA expression correlated with IL18RAP genotype. Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease share HLA-DQ, IL2-IL21, CCR3 and SH2B3 risk regions. Thus, this extensive genome-wide association follow-up study has identified additional celiac disease risk variants in relevant biological pathways.},

abstract = {Genetical genomics is a useful approach for studying the effect of genetic perturbations on biological systems at the molecular level. However, molecular networks depend on the environmental conditions and, thus, a comprehensive understanding of biological systems requires studying them across multiple environments. We propose a generalization of genetical genomics, which combines genetic and sensibly chosen environmental perturbations, to study the plasticity of molecular networks. This strategy forms a crucial step toward understanding why individuals respond differently to drugs, toxins, pathogens, nutrients and other environmental influences. Here we outline a strategy for selecting and allocating individuals to particular treatments, and we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the generalized genetical genomics approach.},

abstract = {Lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Salinas') seeds fail to germinate when imbibed at temperatures above 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C (termed thermoinhibition). However, seeds of an accession of Lactuca serriola (UC96US23) do not exhibit thermoinhibition up to 37 degrees C in the light. Comparative genetics, physiology, and gene expression were analyzed in these genotypes to determine the mechanisms governing the regulation of seed germination by temperature. Germination of the two genotypes was differentially sensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) at elevated temperatures. Quantitative trait loci associated with these phenotypes colocated with a major quantitative trait locus (Htg6.1) from UC96US23 conferring germination thermotolerance. ABA contents were elevated in Salinas seeds that exhibited thermoinhibition, consistent with the ability of fluridone (an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor) to improve germination at high temperatures. Expression of many genes involved in ABA, GA, and ethylene biosynthesis, metabolism, and response was differentially affected by high temperature and light in the two genotypes. In general, ABA-related genes were more highly expressed when germination was inhibited, and GA- and ethylene-related genes were more highly expressed when germination was permitted. In particular, LsNCED4, a gene encoding an enzyme in the ABA biosynthetic pathway, was up-regulated by high temperature only in Salinas seeds and also colocated with Htg6.1. The temperature sensitivity of expression of LsNCED4 may determine the upper temperature limit for lettuce seed germination and may indirectly influence other regulatory pathways via interconnected effects of increased ABA biosynthesis.},

Brown rice kernels were soaked and incubated for a total of 96 h under ambient conditions. Samples taken during the germination process were subjected to an extraction and fractionation procedure covering a broad spectrum of lipophilic (e.g., fatty acid methyl esters, hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, sterols) and hydrophilic (e.g., sugars, acids, amino acids, amines) low molecular weight rice constituents. Investigation of the obtained fractions by GC resulted in the detection of 615 distinct peaks, of which 174 were identified by means of MS. Statistical assessment of the data via principal component analysis demonstrated that the metabolic changes during the germination process are reflected by time-dependent shifts of the scores, which were similar for the three rice materials investigated. Analysis of the corresponding loadings showed that polar metabolites were major contributors to the separation along the first principal component. Relative quantifications based on standardized peak heights revealed dynamic changes of the metabolites in the course of the germination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dormancy is a complex trait finely regulated by hormones and environmental factors. The phytochromes that sense red:far-red (R:FR) are the sole photoreceptors involved in the termination of dormancy and the induction of germination by light. The aims of this study were to identify and characterize loci controlling this process in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. METHODS: Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Landsberg erecta and Cape Verde Islands (Ler x Cvi), and Bayreuth and Shahdara (Bay-0 x Sha) were used to map loci related to light effects in seeds previously exposed to chilling and after-ripening periods. KEY RESULTS: Substantial genetic variation was found between accessions of A. thaliana in the induction of germination by light. Twelve loci were identified under R, FR or darkness, some of which were novel loci: DOG8, DOG9, DOG13, DOG14 and DOG15 detected in the Ler x Cvi RIL population; and DOG10, DOG11 and DOG12 mapped in the Bay-0 x Sha RIL population. Furthermore, independent loci were mapped for the induction of germination by low fluence (DOG-LF1 and DOG-LF2) and very low fluence of light (DOG-VLF1) in the Ler x Cvi RIL population. Several loci were confirmed and characterized after different after-ripening and chilling treatments through near-isogenic lines (NILs) and heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that one group of loci act in a wide range of environmental scenarios, whereas a smaller group of loci are relevant only under a narrower set of conditions when the influence of the most-prevalent loci is reduced as a consequence of changes in the physiological status of the seeds. In addition, the identification of specific loci controlling the action modes of the phytochromes improves our understanding of the two independent signalling pathways that promote germination in response to light.},

abstract = {Genomic approaches have accelerated the study of the quantitative genetics that underlie phenotypic variation. These approaches associate genome-scale analyses such as transcript profiling with targeted phenotypes such as measurements of specific metabolites. Additionally, these approaches can help identify uncharacterized networks or pathways. However, little is known about the genomic architecture underlying data sets such as metabolomics or the potential of such data sets to reveal networks. To describe the genetic regulation of variation in the Arabidopsis thaliana metabolome and test our ability to integrate unknown metabolites into biochemical networks, we conducted a replicated metabolomic analysis on 210 lines of an Arabidopsis population that was previously used for targeted metabolite quantitative trait locus (QTL) and global expression QTL analysis. Metabolic traits were less heritable than the average transcript trait, suggesting that there are differences in the power to detect QTLs between transcript and metabolite traits. We used statistical analysis to identify a large number of metabolite QTLs with moderate phenotypic effects and found frequent epistatic interactions controlling a majority of the variation. The distribution of metabolite QTLs across the genome included 11 QTL clusters; 8 of these clusters were associated in an epistatic network that regulated plant central metabolism. We also generated two de novo biochemical network models from the available data, one of unknown function and the other associated with central plant metabolism.},

abstract = {An increasing number of phylogenetic analyses are based on the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). They mainly use the fast evolving sequence for low-level analyses. When considering the highly conserved structure, the same marker could also be used for higher level phylogenies. Furthermore, structural features of the ITS2 allow distinguishing different species from each other. Despite its importance, the correct structure is only rarely found by standard RNA folding algorithms. To overcome this hindrance for a wider application of the ITS2, we have developed a homology modelling approach to predict the structure of RNA and present the results of modelling the ITS2 in the ITS2 Database. Here, we describe the database and the underlying algorithms which allowed us to predict the structure for 86 784 sequences, which is more than 55\% of all GenBank entries concerning the ITS2. These are not equally distributed over all genera. There is a substantial amount of genera where the structure of nearly all sequences is predicted whereas for others no structure at all was found despite high sequence coverage. These genera might have evolved an ITS2 structure diverging from the standard one. The current version of the ITS2 Database can be accessed via http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.},

abstract = {The effects of genetic variants on phenotypic traits often depend on environmental and physiological conditions, but such gene-environment interactions are poorly understood. Recently developed approaches that treat transcript abundances of thousands of genes as quantitative traits offer the opportunity to broadly characterize the architecture of gene-environment interactions. We examined the genetic and molecular basis of variation in gene expression between two yeast strains (BY and RM) grown in two different conditions (glucose and ethanol as carbon sources). We observed that most transcripts vary by strain and condition, with 2,996, 3,448, and 2,037 transcripts showing significant strain, condition, and strain-condition interaction effects, respectively. We expression profiled over 100 segregants derived from a cross between BY and RM in both growth conditions, and identified 1,555 linkages for 1,382 transcripts that show significant gene-environment interaction. At the locus level, local linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms in cis-regulatory elements, tend to be more stable across conditions, such that they are more likely to show the same effect or the same direction of effect across conditions. Distant linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms influencing trans-acting factors, are more condition-dependent, and often show effects in different directions in the two conditions. We characterized a locus that influences expression of many growth-related transcripts, and showed that the majority of the variation is explained by polymorphism in the gene IRA2. The RM allele of IRA2 appears to inhibit Ras/PKA signaling more strongly than the BY allele, and has undergone a change in selective pressure. Our results provide a broad overview of the genetic architecture of gene-environment interactions, as well as a detailed molecular example, and lead to key insights into how the effects of different classes of regulatory variants are modulated by the environment. These observations will guide the design of studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.},

abstract = {Plant growth and development are tightly linked to primary metabolism and are subject to natural variation. In order to obtain an insight into the genetic factors controlling biomass and primary metabolism and to determine their relationships, two Arabidopsis thaliana populations [429 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and 97 introgression lines (IL), derived from accessions Col-0 and C24] were analyzed with respect to biomass and metabolic composition using a mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach. Six and 157 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for biomass and metabolic content, respectively. Two biomass QTL coincide with significantly more metabolic QTL (mQTL) than statistically expected, supporting the notion that the metabolic profile and biomass accumulation of a plant are linked. On the same basis, three out the six biomass QTL can be simulated purely on the basis of metabolic composition. QTL based on analysis of the introgression lines were in substantial agreement with the RIL-based results: five of six biomass QTL and 55\% of the mQTL found in the RIL population were also found in the IL population at a significance level of P < or = 0.05, with >80\% agreement on the allele effects. Some of the differences could be attributed to epistatic interactions. Depending on the search conditions, metabolic pathway-derived candidate genes were found for 24-67\% of all tested mQTL in the database AraCyc 3.5. This dataset thus provides a comprehensive basis for the detection of functionally relevant variation in known genes with metabolic function and for identification of genes with hitherto unknown roles in the control of metabolism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular biological responses to specific stimulation are determined by a balance among signaling pathways. Protein interactions are likely to modulate these pathways. Vaccinia-related kinase-2 (VRK2) is a novel human kinase that can modulate different signaling pathways. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report that in vivo, the activity of JIP1-JNK complexes is downregulated by VRK2 in response to interleukin-1beta. Also the reduction of endogenous VRK2 with shRNA increases the transcriptional response to IL-1beta. The JIP1 scaffold protein assembles three consecutive members of a given MAPK pathway forming signaling complexes and their signal can be modulated by interactions with regulatory proteins that remain to be identified. Knocking-down JIP1 with siRNA resulted in elimination of the AP1 transcriptional response to IL-1beta. VRK2, a member of novel Ser-Thr kinase family, is able to stably interact with JIP1, TAK1 and MKK7, but not JNK, and can be isolated forming oligomeric complexes with different proportions of TAK1, MKK7beta1 and JNK. JIP1 assembles all these proteins in an oligomeric signalosome. VRK2 binding to the JIP1 signalosome prevents the association of JNK and results in a reduction in its phosphorylation and downregulation of AP1-dependent transcription. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work suggests that the intracellular level of VRK2 protein can modulate the flow through a signaling pathway and alter the response from a receptor that can be distributed by more than one pathway, and thus contribute to the cellular specificity of the response by forming alternative signaling complexes. Furthermore, the effect might be more general and affect other signaling routes assembled on the JIP1 scaffold protein for which a model is proposed.},

abstract = {The fundamental aim of genetics is to understand how an organism's phenotype is determined by its genotype, and implicit in this is predicting how changes in DNA sequence alter phenotypes. A single network covering all the genes of an organism might guide such predictions down to the level of individual cells and tissues. To validate this approach, we computationally generated a network covering most C. elegans genes and tested its predictive capacity. Connectivity within this network predicts essentiality, identifying this relationship as an evolutionarily conserved biological principle. Critically, the network makes tissue-specific predictions-we accurately identify genes for most systematically assayed loss-of-function phenotypes, which span diverse cellular and developmental processes. Using the network, we identify 16 genes whose inactivation suppresses defects in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway, and we successfully predict that the dystrophin complex modulates EGF signaling. We conclude that an analogous network for human genes might be similarly predictive and thus facilitate identification of disease genes and rational therapeutic targets.},

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive genomewide mapping strategy for correlated traits in the literature. We develop Bayesian multiple-QTL mapping methods for correlated continuous traits using two multivariate models: one that assumes the same genetic model for all traits, the traditional multivariate model, and the other known as the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model that allows different genetic models for different traits. We develop computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for performing joint analysis. We conduct extensive simulation studies to assess the performance of the proposed methods and to compare with the conventional single-trait model. Our methods have been implemented in the freely available package R/qtlbim (http://www.qtlbim.org), which greatly facilitates the general usage of the Bayesian methodology for unraveling the genetic architecture of complex traits.},

@article{Sheppard:2008,
abstract = {Aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are the essential substrates for translation. Most aa-tRNAs are formed by direct aminoacylation of tRNA catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, a smaller number of aa-tRNAs (Asn-tRNA, Gln-tRNA, Cys-tRNA and Sec-tRNA) are made by synthesizing the amino acid on the tRNA by first attaching a non-cognate amino acid to the tRNA, which is then converted to the cognate one catalyzed by tRNA-dependent modifying enzymes. Asn-tRNA or Gln-tRNA formation in most prokaryotes requires amidation of Asp-tRNA or Glu-tRNA by amidotransferases that couple an amidase or an asparaginase to liberate ammonia with a tRNA-dependent kinase. Both archaeal and eukaryotic Sec-tRNA biosynthesis and Cys-tRNA synthesis in methanogens require O-phosophoseryl-tRNA formation. For tRNA-dependent Cys biosynthesis, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase directly attaches the amino acid to the tRNA which is then converted to Cys by Sep-tRNA: Cys-tRNA synthase. In Sec-tRNA synthesis, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase phosphorylates Ser-tRNA to form the intermediate which is then modified to Sec-tRNA by Sep-tRNA:Sec-tRNA synthase. Complex formation between enzymes in the same pathway may protect the fidelity of protein synthesis. How these tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthetic routes are integrated into overall metabolism may explain why they are still retained in so many organisms.},

This intercross was initially carried out as a control cross for an ethylnitrosurea mutagenesis mapping study. Surprisingly, although open-field behavior is similar in the two strains, we identified significant QTL in their F2 progeny. Marker regression identified a locus on Chr 8 having associations with multiple open-field measures and a significant interaction between loci on Chr 13 and 17. Together, the Chr 8 locus and the interaction effect form the core set of QTL controlling these behaviors with additional loci on Chr 1 and 6 present in a subset of the behaviors.},

abstract = {The torrent of data emerging from the application of new technologies to functional genomics and systems biology can no longer be contained within the traditional modes of data sharing and publication with the consequence that data is being deposited in, distributed across and disseminated through an increasing number of databases. The resulting fragmentation poses serious problems for the model organism community which increasingly rely on data mining and computational approaches that require gathering of data from a range of sources. In the light of these problems, the European Commission has funded a coordination action, CASIMIR (coordination and sustainability of international mouse informatics resources), with a remit to assess the technical and social aspects of database interoperability that currently prevent the full realization of the potential of data integration in mouse functional genomics. In this article, we assess the current problems with interoperability, with particular reference to mouse functional genomics, and critically review the technologies that can be deployed to overcome them. We describe a typical use-case where an investigator wishes to gather data on variation, genomic context and metabolic pathway involvement for genes discovered in a genome-wide screen. We go on to develop an automated approach involving an in silico experimental workflow tool, Taverna, using web services, BioMart and MOLGENIS technologies for data retrieval. Finally, we focus on the current impediments to adopting such an approach in a wider context, and strategies to overcome them.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organisms live in environments that vary. For life-history traits that vary across environments, fitness will be maximised when the phenotype is appropriately matched to the environmental conditions. For the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we have investigated how two major life-history traits, (i) the development of environmentally resistant dauer larvae and (ii) reproduction, respond to environmental stress (high population density and low food availability), and how these traits vary between lines and the genetic basis of this variation. RESULTS: We found that lines of C. elegans vary in their phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva development, i.e. there is variation in the likelihood of developing into a dauer larva for the same environmental change. There was also variation in how lifetime fecundity and the rate of reproduction changed under conditions of environmental stress. These traits were related, such that lines that are highly plastic for dauer larva development also maintain a high population growth rate when stressed. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on two chromosomes that control the dauer larva development and population size phenotypes. The QTLs affecting the dauer larva development and population size phenotypes on chromosome II are closely linked, but are genetically separable. This chromosome II QTL controlling dauer larva development does not encompass any loci previously identified to control dauer larva development. This chromosome II region contains many predicted 7-transmembrane receptors. Such proteins are often involved in information transduction, which is clearly relevant to the control of dauer larva development. CONCLUSION: C. elegans alters both its larval development and adult reproductive strategy in response to environmental stress. Together the phenotypic and genotypic data suggest that these two major life-history traits are co-ordinated responses to environmental stress and that they are, at least in part, controlled by the same genomic regions.},

Perception and response to these stimuli have to ensure that seedling emergence and growth occur at the most advantageous time for correct establishment. Analysis of over 300 Arabidopsis accessions identified 14, from 12 different geographical locations, that were able to germinate to greater than 20\% at 6 degrees C in the dark. This natural variation was exploited to identify genetic loci responsible for cold-tolerant, dark germination. A quantitative trait loci approach was used on recombinant inbred line progeny of a cross between Bay-0 and Shahdara. Six distinct quantitative trait loci were identified, three of which were major loci, each responsible for 17-25\% of the phenotypic variability in this trait. Parental phenotypes indicated that the majority of the cold-tolerant, dark-germination characteristics are related to light responses. Validation of the three major loci using heterogeneous inbred families confirmed the feasibility of fine mapping and cloning the genes at the quantitative trait loci responsible for cold-tolerant, dark germination.},

abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to pathogenic bacteria with conserved innate immune responses and pathogen avoidance behaviors. We investigated natural variation in C. elegans resistance to pathogen infection. With the use of quantitative genetic analysis, we determined that the pathogen susceptibility difference between the laboratory wild-type strain N2 and the wild isolate CB4856 is caused by a polymorphism in the npr-1 gene, which encodes a homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide Y receptor. We show that the mechanism of NPR-1-mediated pathogen resistance is through oxygen-dependent behavioral avoidance rather than direct regulation of innate immunity. For C. elegans, bacteria represent food but also a potential source of infection. Our data underscore the importance of behavioral responses to oxygen levels in finding an optimal balance between these potentially conflicting cues.},

abstract = {Genetical genomics is a strategy for mapping gene expression variation to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We performed a genetical genomics experiment in four functionally distinct but developmentally closely related hematopoietic cell populations isolated from the BXD panel of recombinant inbred mouse strains. This analysis allowed us to analyze eQTL robustness/sensitivity across different cellular differentiation states. Although we identified a large number (365) of "static" eQTLs that were consistently active in all four cell types, we found a much larger number (1,283) of "dynamic" eQTLs showing cell-type-dependence. Of these, 140, 45, 531, and 295 were preferentially active in stem, progenitor, erythroid, and myeloid cells, respectively. A detailed investigation of those dynamic eQTLs showed that in many cases the eQTL specificity was associated with expression changes in the target gene. We found no evidence for target genes that were regulated by distinct eQTLs in different cell types, suggesting that large-scale changes within functional regulatory networks are uncommon. Our results demonstrate that heritable differences in gene expression are highly sensitive to the developmental stage of the cell population under study. Therefore, future genetical genomics studies should aim at studying multiple well-defined and highly purified cell types in order to construct as comprehensive a picture of the changing functional regulatory relationships as possible.},

abstract = {Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Caenorhabditis elegans wild-type N2 and CB4856 are increasingly being used for mapping genes underlying complex traits. To speed up mapping and gene discovery, introgression lines (ILs) offer a powerful tool for more efficient QTL identification. We constructed a library of 90 ILs, each carrying a single homozygous CB4856 genomic segment introgressed into the genetic background of N2. The ILs were genotyped by 123 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The proportion of the CB4856 segments in most lines does not exceed 3\%, and together the introgressions cover 96\% of the CB4856 genome. The value of the IL library was demonstrated by identifying novel loci underlying natural variation in two ageing-related traits, i.e. lifespan and pharyngeal pumping rate. Bin mapping of lifespan resulted in six QTLs, which all have a lifespan-shortening effect on the CB4856 allele. We found five QTLs for the decrease in pumping rate, of which four colocated with QTLs found for average lifespan. This suggests pleiotropic or closely linked QTL associated with lifespan and pumping rate. Overall, the presented IL library provides a versatile resource toward easier and efficient fine mapping and functional analyses of loci and genes underlying complex traits in C. elegans.},

abstract = {Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have a role in many physiological processes, including energy production, modulation of inflammation, and maintenance of cell membrane integrity. High plasma PUFA concentrations have been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality. To identify genetic contributors of plasma PUFA concentrations, we conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma levels of six omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in 1,075 participants in the InCHIANTI study on aging. The strongest evidence for association was observed in a region of chromosome 11 that encodes three fatty acid desaturases (FADS1, FADS2, FADS3). The SNP with the most significant association was rs174537 near FADS1 in the analysis of arachidonic acid (AA; p = 5.95 x 10(-46)). Minor allele homozygotes had lower AA compared to the major allele homozygotes and rs174537 accounted for 18.6\% of the additive variance in AA concentrations. This SNP was also associated with levels of eicosadienoic acid (EDA; p = 6.78 x 10(-9)) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA; p = 1.07 x 10(-14)). Participants carrying the allele associated with higher AA, EDA, and EPA also had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels. Outside the FADS gene cluster, the strongest region of association mapped to chromosome 6 in the region encoding an elongase of very long fatty acids 2 (ELOVL2). In this region, association was observed with EPA (rs953413; p = 1.1 x 10(-6)). The effects of rs174537 were confirmed in an independent sample of 1,076 subjects participating in the GOLDN study. The ELOVL2 SNP was associated with docosapentanoic and DHA but not with EPA in GOLDN. These findings show that polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes in the metabolism of PUFA contribute to plasma concentrations of fatty acids.},

@article{Jeuken:2009,
abstract = {Some inter- and intraspecific crosses may result in reduced viability or sterility in the offspring, often due to genetic incompatibilities resulting from interactions between two or more loci. Hybrid necrosis is a postzygotic genetic incompatibility that is phenotypically manifested as necrotic lesions on the plant. We observed hybrid necrosis in interspecific lettuce (Lactuca sativa and Lactuca saligna) hybrids that correlated with resistance to downy mildew. Segregation analysis revealed a specific allelic combination at two interacting loci to be responsible. The allelic interaction had two consequences: (1) a quantitative temperature-dependent autoimmunity reaction leading to necrotic lesions, lethality, and quantitative resistance to an otherwise virulent race of Bremia lactucae; and (2) a qualitative temperature-independent race-specific resistance to an avirulent race of B. lactucae. We demonstrated by transient expression and silencing experiments that one of the two interacting genes was Rin4. In Arabidopsis thaliana, RIN4 is known to interact with multiple R gene products, and their interactions result in hypersensitive resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Site-directed mutation studies on the necrosis-eliciting allele of Rin4 in lettuce showed that three residues were critical for hybrid necrosis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Permutation tests have become a standard tool to assess the statistical significance of an event under investigation. The statistical significance, as expressed in a P-value, is calculated as the fraction of permutation values that are at least as extreme as the original statistic, which was derived from non-permuted data. This empirical method directly couples both the minimal obtainable P-value and the resolution of the P-value to the number of permutations. Thereby, it imposes upon itself the need for a very large number of permutations when small P-values are to be accurately estimated. This is computationally expensive and often infeasible. RESULTS: A method of computing P-values based on tail approximation is presented. The tail of the distribution of permutation values is approximated by a generalized Pareto distribution. A good fit and thus accurate P-value estimates can be obtained with a drastically reduced number of permutations when compared with the standard empirical way of computing P-values. AVAILABILITY: The Matlab code can be obtained from the corresponding author on request. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Sexual antagonism, or conflict between the sexes, has been proposed as a driving force in both sex-chromosome turnover and speciation. Although closely related species often have different sex-chromosome systems, it is unknown whether sex-chromosome turnover contributes to the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Here we show that a newly evolved sex chromosome contains genes that contribute to speciation in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We first identified a neo-sex chromosome system found only in one member of a sympatric species pair in Japan. We then performed genetic linkage mapping of male-specific traits important for reproductive isolation between the Japanese species pair. The neo-X chromosome contains loci for male courtship display traits that contribute to behavioural isolation, whereas the ancestral X chromosome contains loci for both behavioural isolation and hybrid male sterility. Our work not only provides strong evidence for a large X-effect on reproductive isolation in a vertebrate system, but also provides direct evidence that a young neo-X chromosome contributes to reproductive isolation between closely related species. Our data indicate that sex-chromosome turnover might have a greater role in speciation than was previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Flowering locus C (FLC) is a major regulator of flowering responses to seasonal environmental factors. Here, we document that FLC also regulates another major life-history transition-seed germination, and that natural variation at the FLC locus and in FLC expression is associated with natural variation in temperature-dependent germination. FLC-mediated germination acts through additional genes in the flowering pathway (FT, SOC1, and AP1) before involving the abscisic acid catabolic pathway (via CYP707A2) and gibberellins biosynthetic pathway (via GA20ox1) in seeds. Also, FLC regulation of germination is largely maternally controlled, with FLC peaking and FT, SOC1, and AP1 levels declining at late stages of seed maturation. High FLC expression during seed maturation is associated with altered expression of hormonal genes (CYP707A2 and GA20ox1) in germinating seeds, indicating that gene expression before the physiological independence of seeds can influence gene expression well after any physical connection between maternal plants and seeds exists. The major role of FLC in temperature-dependent germination documented here reveals a much broader adaptive significance of natural variation in FLC. Therefore, pleiotropy between these major life stages likely influences patterns of natural selection on this important gene, making FLC a promising case for examining how pleiotropy influences adaptive evolution.},

@article{Orsi:2009,
abstract = {Seed size is a key determinant of evolutionary fitness in plants and is a trait that often undergoes tremendous changes during crop domestication. Seed size is most often quantitatively inherited, and it has been shown that Sw4.1 is one of the most significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying the evolution of seed size in the genus Solanum-especially in species related to the cultivated tomato. Using a combination of genetic, developmental, molecular, and transgenic techniques, we have pinpointed the cause of the Sw4.1 QTL to a gene encoding an ABC transporter gene. This gene exerts its control on seed size, not through the maternal plant, but rather via gene expression in the developing zygote. Phenotypic effects of allelic variation at Sw4.1 are manifested early in seed development at stages corresponding to the rapid deposition of starch and lipids into the endospermic cells. Through synteny, we have identified the Arabidopsis Sw4.1 ortholog. Mutagenesis has revealed that this ortholog is associated with seed length variation and fatty acid deposition in seeds, raising the possibility that the ABC transporter may modulate seed size variation in other species. Transcription studies show that the ABC transporter gene is expressed not only in seeds, but also in other tissues (leaves and roots) and, thus, may perform functions in parts of the plants other than developing seeds. Cloning and characterization of the Sw4.1 QTL gives new insight into how plants change seed during evolution and may open future opportunities for modulating seed size in crop plants for human purposes.},

abstract = {The expression of motor activity levels in response to novel situations is under complex genetic and environmental control. Several genetic loci have been implicated in the regulation of this behavioral phenotype, but their relationship to epigenetic and epistatic interactions is relatively unknown. Here, we report on a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on mouse chromosome 1 for novelty-induced motor activity in the open field, using chromosome substitution strains derived from a high active host strain (C57BL/6J) and a low active donor strain (A/J). The QTL for open field (horizontal distance moved) peaked at the location of Kcnj9, however, QTL detection was initially masked by an interplay of both grandparent genetic origin and genetic co-factors influencing behavior on chromosome 1. Our findings indicate that epigenetic interactions can play an important role in the identification of behavioral QTLs and must be taken into consideration when applying behavioral genetic strategies.},

abstract = {Systems biology aims to develop mathematical models of biological systems by integrating experimental and theoretical techniques. During the last decade, many systems biological approaches that base on genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from experimental data through computational methods. Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. The review provides an overview of common modelling schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current challenges in GRN modelling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-dimensional biomolecular profiling of genetically different individuals in one or more environmental conditions is an increasingly popular strategy for exploring the functioning of complex biological systems. The optimal design of such genetical genomics experiments in a cost-efficient and effective way is not trivial. RESULTS: This paper presents designGG, an R package for designing optimal genetical genomics experiments. A web implementation for designGG is available at http://gbic.biol.rug.nl/designGG. All software, including source code and documentation, is freely available. CONCLUSION: DesignGG allows users to intelligently select and allocate individuals to experimental units and conditions such as drug treatment. The user can maximize the power and resolution of detecting genetic, environmental and interaction effects in a genome-wide or local mode by giving more weight to genome regions of special interest, such as previously detected phenotypic quantitative trait loci. This will help to achieve high power and more accurate estimates of the effects of interesting factors, and thus yield a more reliable biological interpretation of data. DesignGG is applicable to linkage analysis of experimental crosses, e.g. recombinant inbred lines, as well as to association analysis of natural populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome wide association studies have been hugely successful in identifying disease risk variants, yet most variants do not lead to coding changes and how variants influence biological function is usually unknown. METHODS: We correlated gene expression and genetic variation in untouched primary leucocytes (n = 110) from individuals with celiac disease - a common condition with multiple risk variants identified. We compared our observations with an EBV-transformed HapMap B cell line dataset (n = 90), and performed a meta-analysis to increase power to detect non-tissue specific effects. RESULTS: In celiac peripheral blood, 2,315 SNP variants influenced gene expression at 765 different transcripts (< 250 kb from SNP, at FDR = 0.05, cis expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs). 135 of the detected SNP-probe effects (reflecting 51 unique probes) were also detected in a HapMap B cell line published dataset, all with effects in the same allelic direction. Overall gene expression differences within the two datasets predominantly explain the limited overlap in observed cis-eQTLs. Celiac associated risk variants from two regions, containing genes IL18RAP and CCR3, showed significant cis genotype-expression correlations in the peripheral blood but not in the B cell line datasets. We identified 14 genes where a SNP affected the expression of different probes within the same gene, but in opposite allelic directions. By incorporating genetic variation in co-expression analyses, functional relationships between genes can be more significantly detected. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the complex nature of genotypic effects in human populations makes the use of a relevant tissue, large datasets, and analysis of different exons essential to enable the identification of the function for many genetic risk variants in common diseases.},

In wild plants, comparable traits have been dissected mainly in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this review, we discuss the major contributions of the analysis of natural variation to our understanding of plant development and physiology, focusing in particular on the timing of germination and flowering, plant growth and morphology, primary metabolism, and mineral accumulation. Overall, functional polymorphisms appear in all types of genes and gene regions, and they may have multiple mutational causes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular metabolism is a fundamental biological system consisting of myriads of enzymatic reactions that together fulfill the basic requirements of life. The recent availability of vast amounts of sequence data from diverse sets of organisms provides an opportunity to systematically examine metabolism from a comparative perspective. Here we supplement existing genome and protein resources with partial genome datasets derived from 193 eukaryotes to present a comprehensive survey of the conservation of metabolism across 26 taxa representing the three domains of life. RESULTS: In general, metabolic enzymes are highly conserved. However, organizing these enzymes within the context of functional pathways revealed a spectrum of conservation from those that are highly conserved (for example, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism enzymes) to those specific to individual taxa (for example, those involved in glycan metabolism and secondary metabolite pathways). Applying a novel co-conservation analysis, KEGG defined pathways did not generally display evolutionary coherence. Instead, such modularity appears restricted to smaller subsets of enzymes. Expanding analyses to a global metabolic network revealed a highly conserved, but nonetheless flexible, 'core' of enzymes largely involved in multiple reactions across different pathways. Enzymes and pathways associated with the periphery of this network were less well conserved and associated with taxon-specific innovations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to an emerging picture in which a core of enzyme activities involving amino acid, energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have evolved to provide the basic functions required for life. However, the precise complement of enzymes associated within this core for each species is flexible.},

abstract = {Studies correlating genetic variation to gene expression facilitate the interpretation of common human phenotypes and disease. As functional variants may be operating in a tissue-dependent manner, we performed gene expression profiling and association with genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on three cell types of 75 individuals. We detected cell type-specific genetic effects, with 69 to 80\% of regulatory variants operating in a cell type-specific manner, and identified multiple expressive quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) per gene, unique or shared among cell types and positively correlated with the number of transcripts per gene. Cell type-specific eQTLs were found at larger distances from genes and at lower effect size, similar to known enhancers. These data suggest that the complete regulatory variant repertoire can only be uncovered in the context of cell-type specificity.},

abstract = {The ratio of red to far-red light (R : FR) experienced by seeds during maturation affects germination, but the genetic regulation of this effect is poorly understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, responses to R : FR are governed by five phytochrome photoreceptors, PHYA-PHYE. PHYA, PHYB and PHYE mediate germination, but their roles in germination response to the seed maturation environment are largely unknown. Seeds of A. thaliana phytochrome mutants and natural accessions were matured in a factorial combination of cold (16 degrees C) and warm (24 degrees C) temperatures and high (R : FR = 1) and low (R : FR = 0.6) R : FR environments, resembling sunlight and foliar shade, respectively. Germination was observed in resulting seeds. All five phytochromes mediated germination responses to seed maturation temperature and/or R : FR environment. PHYA suppressed germination in seeds matured under cold temperature, and PHYB promoted germination under the same conditions. PHYD and PHYE promoted germination of seeds matured under warm temperature, but this effect diminished when seeds matured under reduced R : FR. The A. thaliana natural accessions exhibited interesting variation in germination responses to the experimental conditions. Our results suggest that the role of individual PHY loci in regulating plant responses to R : FR varies depending on temperature and provide novel insights into the genetic basis of maternal effects.},

abstract = {Numerous epidemiological studies and some pharmacological clinical trials show the close connection between Alzheimer disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and thereby, shed more light into the existence of possible similar pathogenic mechanisms between these two diseases. Diabetes increases the risk of developing AD and sensitizers of insulin currently used as diabetes drugs can efficiently slow cognitive decline of the neurological disorder. Deposits of amyloid aggregate and hyperphosphorylation of tau, which are hallmarks of AD, have been also found in degenerating pancreatic islets beta-cells of patients with T2D. These events may have a causal role in the pathogenesis of the two diseases. Increased c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activity is found in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of AD and promotes programmed cell death of beta-cells exposed to a diabetic environment. The JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1), also called islet brain 1 (IB1) because it is mostly expressed in the brain and islets, is a key regulator of the JNK pathway in neuronal and beta-cells. JNK, hyperphosphorylated tau and IB1/JIP-1 all co-localize with amyloids deposits in NFT and islets of AD and patients with T2D. This review discusses the role of the IB1/JIP-1 and the JNK pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of AD and T2D.},

abstract = {Selection pressure exerted by insects and microorganisms shapes the diversity of plant secondary metabolites. We identified a metabolic pathway for glucosinolates, known insect deterrents, that differs from the pathway activated by chewing insects. This pathway is active in living plant cells, may contribute to glucosinolate turnover, and has been recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal defense responses. The Arabidopsis CYP81F2 gene encodes a P450 monooxygenase that is essential for the pathogen-induced accumulation of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, which in turn is activated by the atypical PEN2 myrosinase (a type of beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) for antifungal defense. We propose that reiterated enzymatic cycles, controlling the generation of toxic molecules and their detoxification, enable the recruitment of glucosinolates in defense responses.},

abstract = {Transcriptome and metabolite profiling of rice (Oryza sativa) embryo tissue during a detailed time course formed a foundation for examining transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes during germination. One hour after imbibition (HAI), independent of changes in transcript levels, rapid changes in metabolism occurred, including increases in hexose phosphates, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Later changes in the metabolome, including those involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and cell wall metabolism, appeared to be driven by increases in transcript levels, given that the large group (over 6,000 transcripts) observed to increase from 12 HAI were enriched in metabolic functional categories. Analysis of transcripts encoding proteins located in the organelles of primary metabolism revealed that for the mitochondrial gene set, a greater proportion of transcripts peaked early, at 1 or 3 HAI, compared with the plastid set, and notably, many of these transcripts encoded proteins involved in transport functions. One group of over 2,000 transcripts displayed a unique expression pattern beginning with low levels in dry seeds, followed by a peak in expression levels at 1 or 3 HAI, before markedly declining at later time points. This group was enriched in transcription factors and signal transduction components. A subset of these transiently expressed transcription factors were further interrogated across publicly available rice array data, indicating that some were only expressed during the germination process. Analysis of the 1-kb upstream regions of transcripts displaying similar changes in abundance identified a variety of common sequence motifs, potential binding sites for transcription factors. Additionally, newly synthesized transcripts peaking at 3 HAI displayed a significant enrichment of sequence elements in the 3' untranslated region that have been previously associated with RNA instability. Overall, these analyses reveal that during rice germination, an immediate change in some metabolite levels is followed by a two-step, large-scale rearrangement of the transcriptome that is mediated by RNA synthesis and degradation and is accompanied by later changes in metabolite levels.},

abstract = {Characterized as a peripheral metabolic disorder and a degenerative disease of the central nervous system respectively, it is now widely recognized that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share several common abnormalities including impaired glucose metabolism, increased oxidative stress, insulin resistance and amyloidogenesis. Several recent studies suggest that this is not an epiphenomenon, but rather these two diseases disrupt common molecular pathways and each disease compounds the progression of the other. For instance, in AD the accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which characterizes the disease and is thought to participate in the neurodegenerative process, may also induce neuronal insulin resistance. Conversely, disrupting normal glucose metabolism in transgenic animal models of AD that over-express the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) promotes amyloid-peptide aggregation and accelerates the disease progression. Studying these processes at a cellular level suggests that insulin resistance and Abeta aggregation may not only be the consequence of excitotoxicity, aberrant Ca(2+) signals, and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, but may also promote these pathological effectors. At the molecular level, insulin resistance and Abeta disrupt common signal transduction cascades including the insulin receptor family/PI3 kinase/Akt/GSK3 pathway. Thus both disease processes contribute to overlapping pathology, thereby compounding disease symptoms and progression.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has traditionally been considered as an indispensable tool in elucidating structures of metabolites. With the advent of Fourier transform (FT) spectrometers, along with improvements in software and hardware (such as high-field magnets, cryoprobes, versatile pulse sequences, and solvent suppression techniques), NMR is increasingly being considered as a critical quantitative tool, despite its lower sensitivity as compared to mass spectrometry. A specific quantitative application of NMR is in determining the concentrations of biologically isolated metabolites, which could potentially be used as reference standards for further quantitative work by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. With the recent demands from regulatory agencies on quantitative information on metabolites, it is proposed that NMR will play a significant role in strategies aimed at addressing metabolite coverage in toxicological species. Traditionally, biologically isolated metabolites have not been considered as a way of generating "reference standards" for further quantitative work. However, because of the recent FDA guidance on safety testing of metabolites, one has to consider means of authenticating and quantitating biologically or nonbiologically generated metabolites. 1H NMR is being proposed as the method of choice, as it is able to be used as both a qualitative and a quantitative tool, hence allowing structure determination, purity check, and quantitative measurement of the isolated metabolite. In this publication, the application of NMR as a powerful and robust analytical technique in determining the concentrations of in vitro or in vivo isolated metabolites is discussed. Furthermore, to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of metabolite concentrations determined by NMR, validation and cross-validation with gravimetric and mass spectrometric methods were conducted.},

abstract = {The micropylar endosperm cap covering the radicle in the mature seeds of most angiosperms acts as a constraint that regulates seed germination. Here, we report on a comparative seed biology study with the close Brassicaceae relatives Lepidium sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana showing that ethylene biosynthesis and signaling regulate seed germination by a mechanism that requires the coordinated action of the radicle and the endosperm cap. The larger seed size of Lepidium allows direct tissue-specific biomechanical, biochemical, and transcriptome analyses. We show that ethylene promotes endosperm cap weakening of Lepidium and endosperm rupture of both species and that it counteracts the inhibitory action of abscisic acid (ABA) on these two processes. Cross-species microarrays of the Lepidium micropylar endosperm cap and the radicle show that the ethylene-ABA antagonism involves both tissues and has the micropylar endosperm cap as a major target. Ethylene counteracts the ABA-induced inhibition without affecting seed ABA levels. The Arabidopsis loss-of-function mutants ACC oxidase2 (aco2; ethylene biosynthesis) and constitutive triple response1 (ethylene signaling) are impaired in the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-mediated reversion of the ABA-induced inhibition of seed germination. Ethylene production by the ACC oxidase orthologs Lepidium ACO2 and Arabidopsis ACO2 appears to be a key regulatory step. Endosperm cap weakening and rupture are promoted by ethylene and inhibited by ABA to regulate germination in a process conserved across the Brassicaceae.},

Here we show that the C. elegans strains N2 and CB4856 have opposite behavioral responses to simultaneous changes in environmental O(2) and CO(2). We identify two quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect this trait and map each QTL to a single-gene polymorphism. One gene, npr-1, encodes a previously described neuropeptide receptor whose high activity in N2 promotes CO(2) avoidance. The second gene, glb-5, encodes a neuronal globin domain protein whose high activity in CB4856 modifies behavioral responses to O(2) and combined O(2)/CO(2) stimuli. glb-5 acts in O(2)-sensing neurons to increase O(2)-evoked calcium signals, implicating globins in sensory signaling. An analysis of wild C. elegans strains indicates that the N2 alleles of npr-1 and glb-5 arose recently in the same strain background, possibly as an adaptation to laboratory conditions.},

abstract = {The InParanoid project gathers proteomes of completely sequenced eukaryotic species plus Escherichia coli and calculates pairwise ortholog relationships among them. The new release 7.0 of the database has grown by an order of magnitude over the previous version and now includes 100 species and their collective 1.3 million proteins organized into 42.7 million pairwise ortholog groups. The InParanoid algorithm itself has been revised and is now both more specific and sensitive. Based on results from our recent benchmarking of low-complexity filters in homology assignment, a two-pass BLAST approach was developed that makes use of high-precision compositional score matrix adjustment, but avoids the alignment truncation that sometimes follows. We have also updated the InParanoid web site (http://InParanoid.sbc.su.se). Several features have been added, the response times have been improved and the site now sports a new, clearer look. As the number of ortholog databases has grown, it has become difficult to compare among these resources due to a lack of standardized source data and incompatible representations of ortholog relationships. To facilitate data exchange and comparisons among ortholog databases, we have developed and are making available two XML schemas: SeqXML for the input sequences and OrthoXML for the output ortholog clusters.},

abstract = {ABF2 is a basic leucine zipper protein that regulates abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent stress-responsive gene expression. We carried out yeast two-hybrid screens to isolate genes encoding ABF2-interacting proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Analysis of the resulting positive clones revealed that two of them encode an AP2 domain protein, which is the same as AtERF48/DREB2C. This protein, which will be referred to as DREB2C, could bind C-repeat/dehydration response element in vitro and possesses transcriptional activity. To determine its function, we generated DREB2C overexpression lines and investigated their phenotypes. The transgenic plants were ABA hypersensitive during germination and seedling establishment stages, whereas primary root elongation of seedlings was ABA insensitive, suggesting developmental stage dependence of DREB2C function. The DREB2C overexpression lines also displayed altered stress response; whereas the plants were dehydration sensitive, they were freezing and heat tolerant. We further show that other AP2 domain proteins, DREB1A and DREB2A, interact with ABF2 and that other ABF family members, ABF3 and ABF4, interact with DREB2C. Previously, others demonstrated that ABF and DREB family members cooperate to activate the transcription of an ABA-responsive gene. Our result implies that the cooperation of the two classes of transcription factors may involve physical interaction.},

@article{Swertz:2010b,
abstract = {Background: There is a huge demand on bioinformaticians to provide their biologists with user friendly and scalable software infrastructures to capture, exchange, and exploit the unprecedented amounts of new omics data. We here present MOLGENIS, a generic, open source, software toolkit to quickly produce the bespoke MOLecular GENetics Information Systems needed. Methods: The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple language to model biological data structures and user interfaces. At the push of a button, MOLGENIS generator suite automatically translates these models into a feature-rich, ready-to-use web application including database, user interfaces, exchange formats, and scriptable interfaces. Each generator is a template of SQL, JAVA, R, or HTML code that would require much effort to write by hand. This model-driven method ensures reuse of best practices and improves quality because the modeling language and generators are shared between all MOLGENIS applications, so that errors are found quickly and improvements are shared easily by a re-generation. A plug-in mechanism ensures that both the generator suite and generated product can be customized just as much as hand-written software. Results: In recent years we have successfully evaluated the MOLGENIS toolkit for the rapid prototyping of many types of biomedical applications, including next-generation sequencing, GWAS, QTL, proteomics and biobanking. Writing 500 lines of model XML typically replaces 15,000 lines of hand-written programming code, which allows for quick adaptation if the information system is not yet to the biologists satisfaction. Each application generated with MOLGENIS comes with an optimized database back-end, user interfaces for biologists to manage and exploit their data, programming interfaces for bioinformaticians to script analysis tools in R, Java, SOAP, REST/JSON and RDF, a tab-delimited file format to ease upload and exchange of data, and detailed technical documentation. Existing databases can be quickly enhanced with MOLGENIS generated interfaces using the ExtractModel procedure. Conclusions: The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple model to quickly generate flexible web platforms for all possible genomic, molecular and phenotypic experiments with a richness of interfaces not provided by other tools. All the software and manuals are available free as LGPLv3 open source at http://www.molgenis.org.},

This dynamic structure is under continual modification during plant development, and its synthesis and modification require the activity of a myriad of enzymes. The mucilage secretory cells (MSCs) of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat provide a model for the discovery of novel genes involved in the synthesis, secretion and modification of cell wall components, particularly pectin. These cells synthesize copious amounts of pectinaceous mucilage during development and, upon hydration of the desiccated seed, the mucilage rapidly swells, bursts from the MSCs and surrounds the seed in a gelatinous capsule. Several genes affecting MSC differentiation, pectin synthesis, and mucilage release have been identified and additional genes involved in these and related processes including pectin secretion and the mechanical alteration of cell walls await to be discovered.},

abstract = {A study on the codominant scoring of AFLP markers in association panels without prior knowledge on genotype probabilities is described. Bands are scored codominantly by fitting normal mixture models to band intensities, illustrating and optimizing existing methodology, which employs the EM-algorithm. We study features that improve the performance of the algorithm, and the unmixing in general, like parameter initialization, restrictions on parameters, data transformation, and outlier removal. Parameter restrictions include equal component variances, equal or nearly equal distances between component means, and mixing probabilities according to Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Histogram visualization of band intensities with superimposed normal densities, and optional classification scores and other grouping information, assists further in the codominant scoring. We find empirical evidence favoring the square root transformation of the band intensity, as was found in segregating populations. Our approach provides posterior genotype probabilities for marker loci. These probabilities can form the basis for association mapping and are more useful than the standard scoring categories A, H, B, C, D. They can also be used to calculate predictors for additive and dominance effects. Diagnostics for data quality of AFLP markers are described: preference for three-component mixture model, good separation between component means, and lack of singletons for the component with highest mean. Software has been developed in R, containing the models for normal mixtures with facilitating features, and visualizations. The methods are applied to an association panel in tomato, comprising 1,175 polymorphic markers on 94 tomato hybrids, as part of a larger study within the Dutch Centre for BioSystems Genomics.},

We discuss physiological processes as well as gene expression and metabolic programs occurring during the desiccation phase in respect to their contribution to the desiccation tolerance, dormancy competence and successful germination of the dry seeds. The transition of developing seeds from the phase of reserve accumulation to desiccation is associated with distinct gene expression and metabolic switches. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the gene expression and metabolic signatures of seed desiccation resemble those characterizing seed germination, implying that the preparation of the seeds for germination begins already during seed desiccation.},

@article{Vallejo:2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Water and salt stresses are two important environmental factors that limit the germination of seeds in most ecological environments. Most studies conducted so far to address the genetic basis of the above phenomenon have used stress conditions that are much more extreme than those found in natural environments. Furthermore, although an excess of ions and water restrictions have similar osmotic effects on germination, the common and divergent signalling components mediating the effects of both factors remain unknown. METHODS: The germination of seeds was compared under solutions of NaCl (50 mm) and polyethylene glycol (PEG, -0·6 MPa), that establish mild stress conditions, in 28 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Because Bayreuth (Bay) and Shadara (Sha) accessions showed contrasting sensitivity responses to both stresses, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was carried out using Bay × Sha recombinant inbred lines (RILs) to identify loci involved in the control of germination under mild salt and osmotic stresses. KEY RESULTS: Two loci associated with the salt sensitivity response, named SSR1 and SSR2 QTLs, and four loci for the osmotic sensitivity response, named OSR1-OSR4 QTLs, were mapped. The effects of the SSR1 QTL on toxic salt sensitivity, and the osmotic contribution of OSR1, were confirmed by heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs). Whilst the SSR1 QTL had a significant effect under a wide range of NaCl concentrations, the OSR1 QTL was confirmed only under moderate drought stress. Interestingly the OSR1 QTL also showed pleiotropic effects on biomass accumulation in response to water deficit. CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of germination under moderate salt and osmotic stresses involves the action of independent major loci, revealing the existence of loci specifically associated with the toxic component of salt and not just its osmotic effect. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that novel loci control germination under osmotic stress conditions simulating more realistic ecological environments as found by populations of seeds in nature.},

abstract = {Gene expression differences between individuals within a species can be largely explained by differences in genetic background. The effect of genetic variants (alleles) of genes on expression can be studied in a multifactorial way by the application of genetical genomics or expression quantitative trait locus mapping. In this paper, we present a strategy to construct regulatory networks by the application of genetical genomics in combination with transcript profiling of mutants that are disrupted in single genes. We describe the network identification downstream of the receptor-like kinase ERECTA in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Extending genetical genomics on the Landsberg erecta/Cape Verde Islands (Ler/Cvi) recombinant inbred population with expression profiling of monogenic mutants enabled the identification of regulatory networks in the so far elusive ERECTA signal transduction cascade. We provide evidence that ERECTA is the causal gene for the major hotspot for transcript regulation in the Arabidopsis Ler/Cvi recombinant inbred population. We further propose additional genetic variation between Ler and Cvi in loci of the signaling pathway downstream of ERECTA and suggest candidate genes underlying these loci. Integration of publicly available microarray expression data of other monogenic mutants allowed us to link ERECTA to a downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. Our study shows that microarray data of monogenic mutants can be effectively used in combination with genetical genomics data to enhance the identification of genetic regulatory networks.},

To better understand the genetic underpinnings of natural variation in other complex phenotypes, C. elegans is uniquely poised in the emerging field of quantitative systems biology because of the extensive knowledge of cellular and neural bases to such traits. However, perturbations in standing genetic variation and patterns of linkage disequilibrium among loci are likely to limit our ability to tie understanding of molecular function to a broader evolutionary context. Coupling the experimental strengths of the C. elegans system with the ecological advantages of closely related nematodes should provide a powerful means of understanding both the molecular and evolutionary genetics of quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Timing of germination is presumably under strong natural selection as it determines the environmental conditions in which a plant germinates and initiates its postembryonic life cycle. To investigate how seed dormancy is controlled, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses has been performed in six Arabidopsis thaliana recombinant inbred line populations by analyzing them simultaneously using a mixed model QTL approach. The recombinant inbred line populations were derived from crosses between the reference accession Landsberg erecta (Ler) and accessions from different world regions. In total, 11 delay of germination (DOG) QTL have been identified, and nine of them have been confirmed by near isogenic lines (NILs). The absence of strong epistatic interactions between the different DOG loci suggests that they affect dormancy mainly by distinct genetic pathways. This was confirmed by analyzing the transcriptome of freshly harvested dry seeds of five different DOG NILs. All five DOG NILs showed discernible and different expression patterns compared with the expression of their genetic background Ler. The genes identified in the different DOG NILs represent largely different gene ontology profiles. It is proposed that natural variation for seed dormancy in Arabidopsis is mainly controlled by different additive genetic and molecular pathways rather than epistatic interactions, indicating the involvement of several independent pathways.},

In classical quantitative genetic models, drift is a function of the effective population size and acts uniformly across traits, whereas mutation and selection act trait-specifically. We identified thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing transcript abundance traits in a cross of two Caenorhabditis elegans strains; although trait-specific mutation and selection explained some of the observed pattern of QTL distribution, the pattern was better explained by trait-independent variation in the intensity of selection on linked sites. Our results suggest that traits in C. elegans exhibit different levels of variation less because of their own attributes than because of differences in the effective population sizes of the genomic regions harboring their underlying loci.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic network models have been successfully used to describe metabolism in a variety of microbial organisms as well as specific mammalian cell types and organelles. This systems-based framework enables the exploration of global phenotypic effects of gene knockouts, gene insertion, and up-regulation of gene expression. We have developed a genome-scale metabolic network model (AraGEM) covering primary metabolism for a compartmentalized plant cell based on the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. AraGEM is a comprehensive literature-based, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts for the functions of 1,419 unique open reading frames, 1,748 metabolites, 5,253 gene-enzyme reaction-association entries, and 1,567 unique reactions compartmentalized into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid, peroxisome, and vacuole. The curation process identified 75 essential reactions with respective enzyme associations not assigned to any particular gene in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes or AraCyc. With the addition of these reactions, AraGEM describes a functional primary metabolism of Arabidopsis. The reconstructed network was transformed into an in silico metabolic flux model of plant metabolism and validated through the simulation of plant metabolic functions inferred from the literature. Using efficient resource utilization as the optimality criterion, AraGEM predicted the classical photorespiratory cycle as well as known key differences between redox metabolism in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plant cells. AraGEM is a viable framework for in silico functional analysis and can be used to derive new, nontrivial hypotheses for exploring plant metabolism.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades seed physiology research has contributed to many important scientific discoveries and has provided valuable tools for the production of high quality seeds. An important instrument for this type of research is the accurate quantification of germination; however gathering cumulative germination data is a very laborious task that is often prohibitive to the execution of large experiments. In this paper we present the germinator package: a simple, highly cost-efficient and flexible procedure for high-throughput automatic scoring and evaluation of germination that can be implemented without the use of complex robotics. The germinator package contains three modules: (i) design of experimental setup with various options to replicate and randomize samples; (ii) automatic scoring of germination based on the color contrast between the protruding radicle and seed coat on a single image; and (iii) curve fitting of cumulative germination data and the extraction, recap and visualization of the various germination parameters. The curve-fitting module enables analysis of general cumulative germination data and can be used for all plant species. We show that the automatic scoring system works for Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica spp. seeds, but is likely to be applicable to other species, as well. In this paper we show the accuracy, reproducibility and flexibility of the germinator package. We have successfully applied it to evaluate natural variation for salt tolerance in a large population of recombinant inbred lines and were able to identify several quantitative trait loci for salt tolerance. Germinator is a low-cost package that allows the monitoring of several thousands of germination tests, several times a day by a single person.},

abstract = {Valine, leucine and isoleucine form the small group of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) classified by their small branched hydrocarbon residues. Unlike animals, plants are able to de novo synthesize these amino acids from pyruvate, 2-oxobutanoate and acetyl-CoA. In plants, biosynthesis follows the typical reaction pathways established for the formation of these amino acids in microorganisms. Val and Ile are synthesized in two parallel pathways using a single set of enzymes. The pathway to Leu branches of from the final intermediate of Val biosynthesis. The formation of this amino acid requires a three-step pathway generating a 2-oxoacid elongated by a methylene group. In Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae, a homologous three-step pathway is also involved in Met chain elongation required for the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates, an important class of specialized metabolites in Brassicaceae. This is a prime example for the evolutionary relationship of pathways from primary and specialized metabolism. Similar to animals, plants also have the ability to degrade BCAAs. The importance of BCAA turnover has long been unclear, but now it seems apparent that the breakdown process might by relevant under certain environmental conditions. In this review, I summarize the current knowledge about BCAA metabolism, its regulation and its particular features in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

abstract = {Colonizing species may often encounter strong selection during the initial stages of adaptation to novel environments. Such selection is particularly likely to act on traits expressed early in development since early survival is necessary for the expression of adaptive phenotypes later in life. Genetic studies of fitness under field conditions, however, seldom include the earliest developmental stages. Using a new set of recombinant inbred lines, we present a study of the genetic basis of fitness variation in Arabidopsis thaliana in which genotypes, environments, and geographic location were manipulated to study total lifetime fitness, beginning with the seed stage. Large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fitness changed allele frequency and closely approached 90\% in some treatments within a single generation. These QTLs colocated with QTLs for germination phenology when seeds were dispersed following a schedule of a typical winter annual, and they were detected in two geographic locations at different latitudes. Epistatically interacting loci affected both fitness and germination in many cases. QTLs for field germination phenology colocated with known QTLs for primary dormancy induction as assessed in laboratory tests, including the candidate genes DOG1 and DOG6. Therefore fitness, germination phenology, and primary dormancy are genetically associated at the level of specific chromosomal regions and candidate loci. Genes associated with the ability to arrest development at early life stages and assess environmental conditions are thereby likely targets of intense natural selection early in the colonization process.},

abstract = {Psoriasis, an immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the skin and joints, provides an ideal system for expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, because it has a strong genetic basis and disease-relevant tissue (skin) is readily accessible. To better understand the role of genetic variants regulating cutaneous gene expression, we identified 841 cis-acting eQTLs using RNA extracted from skin biopsies of 53 psoriatic individuals and 57 healthy controls. We found substantial overlap between cis-eQTLs of normal control, uninvolved psoriatic, and lesional psoriatic skin. Consistent with recent studies and with the idea that control of gene expression can mediate relationships between genetic variants and disease risk, we found that eQTL SNPs are more likely to be associated with psoriasis than are randomly selected SNPs. To explore the tissue specificity of these eQTLs and hence to quantify the benefits of studying eQTLs in different tissues, we developed a refined statistical method for estimating eQTL overlap and used it to compare skin eQTLs to a published panel of lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) eQTLs. Our method accounts for the fact that most eQTL studies are likely to miss some true eQTLs as a result of power limitations and shows that ∼70\% of cis-eQTLs in LCLs are shared with skin, as compared with the naive estimate of < 50\% sharing. Our results provide a useful method for estimating the overlap between various eQTL studies and provide a catalog of cis-eQTLs in skin that can facilitate efforts to understand the functional impact of identified susceptibility variants on psoriasis and other skin traits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large microarray datasets have enabled gene regulation to be studied through coexpression analysis. While numerous methods have been developed for identifying differentially expressed genes between two conditions, the field of differential coexpression analysis is still relatively new. More specifically, there is so far no sensitive and untargeted method to identify gene modules (also known as gene sets or clusters) that are differentially coexpressed between two conditions. Here, sensitive and untargeted means that the method should be able to construct de novo modules by grouping genes based on shared, but subtle, differential correlation patterns. RESULTS: We present DiffCoEx, a novel method for identifying correlation pattern changes, which builds on the commonly used Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) framework for coexpression analysis. We demonstrate its usefulness by identifying biologically relevant, differentially coexpressed modules in a rat cancer dataset. CONCLUSIONS: DiffCoEx is a simple and sensitive method to identify gene coexpression differences between multiple conditions.},

Different patterns of chromatin composition and histone modification were revealed between chromosome arms and centers, with similarly prominent differences between autosomes and the X chromosome. Integrating data types, we built statistical models relating chromatin, transcription factor binding, and gene expression.

In this study quantitative genetics using natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana was used to investigate the genetic architecture of plant responses to salt stress. Eighty seven A. thaliana accessions were screened and showed a large variation for root development and seed germination under 125 and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. Twenty two quantitative trait loci for these traits have been detected by phenotyping two recombinants inbred line populations, Sha x Col and Sha x Ler. Four QTLs controlling germination under salt were detected in the Sha x Col population. Interestingly, only one allelic combination at these four QTLs inhibits germination under salt stress, implying strong epistatic interactions between them. In this interacting context, we confirmed the effect of one QTL by phenotyping selected heterozygous inbred families. We also showed that this QTL is involved in the control of germination under other stress conditions such as KCl, mannitol, cold, glucose and ABA. Our data highlights the presence of a genetic network which consists of four interacting QTLs and controls germination under limiting environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The biological significance of interactions of nuclear proteins with DNA in the context of gene expression, cell differentiation, or disease has immensely been enhanced by the advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP is a technique whereby a protein of interest is selectively immunoprecipitated from a chromatin preparation to determine the DNA sequences associated with it. ChIP has been widely used to map the localization of post-translationally modified histones, histone variants, transcription factors, or chromatin modifying enzymes on the genome or on a given locus. In spite of its power, ChIP has for a long time remained a cumbersome procedure requiring large numbers of cells. These limitations have sparked the development of modifications to shorten the procedure, simplify sample handling and make ChIP amenable to small numbers of cells. In addition, the combination of ChIP with DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies has in recent years enabled the profiling of histone modification, histone variants, and transcription factor occupancy on a genome-wide scale. This review highlights the variations on the theme of the ChIP assay, the various detection methods applied downstream of ChIP, and examples of their application.},

Although we still have not reached a stage where the elucidation of differential regulatory networks is commonly feasible, recent advances have described the first steps towards this goal - the identification of differential coexpression networks.

abstract = {While recent scans for genetic variation associated with human disease have been immensely successful in uncovering large numbers of loci, far fewer studies have focused on the underlying pathways of disease pathogenesis. Many loci which are associated with disease and complex phenotypes map to non-coding, regulatory regions of the genome, indicating that modulation of gene transcription plays a key role. Thus, this study generated genome-wide profiles of both genetic and transcriptional variation from the total blood extracts of over 500 randomly-selected, unrelated individuals. Using measurements of blood lipids, key players in the progression of atherosclerosis, three levels of biological information are integrated in order to investigate the interactions between circulating leukocytes and proximal lipid compounds. Pair-wise correlations between gene expression and lipid concentration indicate a prominent role for basophil granulocytes and mast cells, cell types central to powerful allergic and inflammatory responses. Network analysis of gene co-expression showed that the top associations function as part of a single, previously unknown gene module, the Lipid Leukocyte (LL) module. This module replicated in T cells from an independent cohort while also displaying potential tissue specificity. Further, genetic variation driving LL module expression included the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) most strongly associated with serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, a key antibody in allergy.

abstract = {Alternative splicing can enhance transcriptome plasticity and proteome diversity. In plants, alternative splicing can be manifested at different developmental stages, and is frequently associated with specific tissue types or environmental conditions such as abiotic stress. We mapped the Arabidopsis transcriptome at single-base resolution using the Illumina platform for ultrahigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Deep transcriptome sequencing confirmed a majority of annotated introns and identified thousands of novel alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. Our analysis suggests that at least approximately 42\% of intron-containing genes in Arabidopsis are alternatively spliced; this is significantly higher than previous estimates based on cDNA/expressed sequence tag sequencing. Random validation confirmed that novel splice isoforms empirically predicted by RNA-seq can be detected in vivo. Novel introns detected by RNA-seq were substantially enriched in nonconsensus terminal dinucleotide splice signals. Alternative isoforms with premature termination codons (PTCs) comprised the majority of alternatively spliced transcripts. Using an example of an essential circadian clock gene, we show that intron retention can generate relatively abundant PTC(+) isoforms and that this specific event is highly conserved among diverse plant species. Alternatively spliced PTC(+) isoforms can be potentially targeted for degradation by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) surveillance machinery or regulate the level of functional transcripts by the mechanism of regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST). We demonstrate that the relative ratios of the PTC(+) and reference isoforms for several key regulatory genes can be considerably shifted under abiotic stress treatments. Taken together, our results suggest that like in animals, NMD and RUST may be widespread in plants and may play important roles in regulating gene expression.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is considered a major mechanism for creating multicellular diversity from a limited repertoire of genes. Here, we performed the first study of genetic variation controlling alternative splicing patterns by comprehensively identifying quantitative trait loci affecting the differential expression of transcript isoforms in a large recombinant inbred population of Caenorhabditis elegans, using a new generation of whole-genome very-high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Using 60 experimental lines, we were able to detect 435 genes with substantial heritable variation, of which 36\% were regulated at a distance (in trans). Nonetheless, we find only a very small number of examples of heritable variation in alternative splicing (22 transcripts), and most of these genes colocalize with the associated genomic loci. Our findings suggest that the regulatory mechanism of alternative splicing in C. elegans is robust toward genetic variation at the genome-wide scale, which is in striking contrast to earlier observations in humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variability of gene expression in human may link gene sequence variability and phenotypes; however, non-genetic variations, alone or in combination with genetics, may also influence expression traits and have a critical role in physiological and disease processes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To get better insight into the overall variability of gene expression, we assessed the transcriptome of circulating monocytes, a key cell involved in immunity-related diseases and atherosclerosis, in 1,490 unrelated individuals and investigated its association with >675,000 SNPs and 10 common cardiovascular risk factors. Out of 12,808 expressed genes, 2,745 expression quantitative trait loci were detected (P<5.78x10(-12)), most of them (90\%) being cis-modulated. Extensive analyses showed that associations identified by genome-wide association studies of lipids, body mass index or blood pressure were rarely compatible with a mediation by monocyte expression level at the locus. At a study-wide level (P<3.9x10(-7)), 1,662 expression traits (13.0\%) were significantly associated with at least one risk factor. Genome-wide interaction analyses suggested that genetic variability and risk factors mostly acted additively on gene expression. Because of the structure of correlation among expression traits, the variability of risk factors could be characterized by a limited set of independent gene expressions which may have biological and clinical relevance. For example expression traits associated with cigarette smoking were more strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis than smoking itself. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that the monocyte transcriptome is a potent integrator of genetic and non-genetic influences of relevance for disease pathophysiology and risk assessment.},

However, the inference process is based on discovering subtle patterns in the correlation between traits and is therefore challenging and could create a flood of untrustworthy causal inferences. Here we introduce the concerns and show that they are already valid in simple scenarios of two traits linked to or associated with the same genomic region. We argue that more comprehensive analysis and Bayesian reasoning are needed and that these can overcome some of the pitfalls, although not in every conceivable case. We conclude that causal inference methods can still be of use in the iterative process of mathematical modeling and biological validation.},

abstract = {Despite our relatively large population size, humans are genetically less variable than other primates. Many allele frequencies and statistical descriptors of genome diversity form broad gradients, tracing the main expansion from Africa, local migrations, and sometimes adaptation. However, this continuous variation is discordant across loci, and principally seems to reflect different blends of common and often cosmopolitan alleles rather than the presence of distinct gene pools in different regions of the world. The elusive structure of human populations could lead to spurious associations if the effects of shared ancestry are not properly dealt with; indeed, this is among the causes (although not the only one) of the difficulties encountered in discovering the loci responsible for quantitative traits and complex diseases. However, the rapidly growing body of data on our genomic diversity has already cast new light on human population history and is now revealing intricate biological relationships among individuals and populations of our species.},

abstract = {Gene expression becomes more variable with age, and it is widely assumed that this is due to a decrease in expression regulation. But currently there is no understanding how gene expression regulatory patterns progress with age. Here we explored genome-wide gene expression variation and regulatory loci (eQTL) in a population of developing and aging C. elegans recombinant inbred worms. We found almost 900 genes with an eQTL, of which almost half were found to have a genotype-by-age effect ((gxa)eQTL). The total number of eQTL decreased with age, whereas the variation in expression increased. In developing worms, the number of genes with increased expression variation (1282) was similar to the ones with decreased expression variation (1328). In aging worms, the number of genes with increased variation (1772) was nearly five times higher than the number of genes with a decreased expression variation (373). The number of cis-acting eQTL in juveniles decreased by almost 50\% in old worms, whereas the number of trans-acting loci decreased by approximately 27\%, indicating that cis-regulation becomes relatively less frequent than trans-regulation in aging worms. Of the 373 genes with decreased expression level variation in aging worms, approximately 39\% had an eQTL compared with approximately 14\% in developing worms. (gxa)eQTL were found for approximately 21\% of these genes in aging worms compared with only approximately 6\% in developing worms. We highlight three examples of linkages: in young worms (pgp-6), in old worms (daf-16), and throughout life (lips-16). Our findings demonstrate that eQTL patterns are strongly affected by age, and suggest that gene network integrity declines with age.},

abstract = {Soil salinity limits agricultural production and is a major obstacle for feeding the growing world population. We used natural genetic variation in salt tolerance among different Arabidopsis accessions to map a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for salt tolerance and abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity during seed germination and early seedling growth. A recombinant inbred population derived from Landsberg erecta (Ler; salt and ABA sensitive) x Shakdara (Sha; salt and ABA resistant) was used for QTL mapping. High-resolution mapping and cloning of this QTL, Response to ABA and Salt 1 (RAS1), revealed that it is an ABA- and salt stress-inducible gene and encodes a previously undescribed plant-specific protein. A premature stop codon results in a truncated RAS1 protein in Sha. Reducing the expression of RAS1 by transfer-DNA insertion in Col or RNA interference in Ler leads to decreased salt and ABA sensitivity, whereas overexpression of the Ler allele but not the Sha allele causes increased salt and ABA sensitivity. Our results suggest that RAS1 functions as a negative regulator of salt tolerance during seed germination and early seedling growth by enhancing ABA sensitivity and that its loss of function contributes to the increased salt tolerance of Sha.},

abstract = {Biologists have long used model organisms to study human diseases, particularly when the model bears a close resemblance to the disease. We present a method that quantitatively and systematically identifies nonobvious equivalences between mutant phenotypes in different species, based on overlapping sets of orthologous genes from human, mouse, yeast, worm, and plant (212,542 gene-phenotype associations). These orthologous phenotypes, or phenologs, predict unique genes associated with diseases. Our method suggests a yeast model for angiogenesis defects, a worm model for breast cancer, mouse models of autism, and a plant model for the neural crest defects associated with Waardenburg syndrome, among others. Using these models, we show that SOX13 regulates angiogenesis, and that SEC23IP is a likely Waardenburg gene. Phenologs reveal functionally coherent, evolutionarily conserved gene networks-many predating the plant-animal divergence-capable of identifying candidate disease genes.},

abstract = {Thyroid disorders such as goiters represent important diseases, especially in iodine-deficient areas. Sibling studies have demonstrated that genetic factors substantially contribute to the interindividual variation of thyroid volume. We performed a genome-wide association study of this phenotype by analyzing a discovery cohort consisting of 3620 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). Four genetic loci were associated with thyroid volume on a genome-wide level of significance. Of these, two independent loci are located upstream of and within CAPZB, which encodes the $\beta$ subunit of the barbed-end F-actin binding protein that modulates actin polymerization, a process crucial in the colloid engulfment during thyroglobulin mobilization in the thyroid. The third locus marks FGF7, which encodes fibroblast growth factor 7. Members of this protein family have been discussed as putative signal molecules involved in the regulation of thyroid development. The fourth locus represents a "gene desert" on chromosome 16q23, located directly downstream of the predicted coding sequence LOC440389, which, however, had already been removed from the NCBI database as a result of the standard genome annotation processing at the time that this study was initiated. Experimental proof of the formerly predicted mature mRNA, however, demonstrates that LOC440389 indeed represents a real gene. All four associations were replicated in an independent sample of 1290 participants of the KORA study. These results increase the knowledge about genetic factors and physiological mechanisms influencing thyroid volume.},

abstract = {Triacylglycerol (TAG) is a major storage reserve in many plant seeds. We previously identified a TAG lipase mutant called sugar-dependent1 (sdp1) that is impaired in TAG hydrolysis following Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed germination (Eastmond, 2006). The aim of this study was to identify additional lipases that account for the residual TAG hydrolysis observed in sdp1. Mutants were isolated in three candidate genes (SDP1-LIKE [SDP1L], ADIPOSE TRIGLYCERIDE LIPASE-LIKE, and COMPARATIVE GENE IDENTIFIER-58-LIKE). Analysis of double, triple, and quadruple mutants showed that SDP1L is responsible for virtually all of the residual TAG hydrolysis present in sdp1 seedlings. Oil body membranes purified from sdp1 sdp1L seedlings were deficient in TAG lipase activity but could still hydrolyze di- and monoacylglycerol. SDP1L is expressed less strongly than SDP1 in seedlings. However, SDP1L could partially rescue TAG breakdown in sdp1 seedlings when expressed under the control of the SDP1 or 35S promoters and in vitro assays showed that both SDP1 and SDP1L can hydrolyze TAG, in preference to diacylglycerol or monoacylglycerol. Seed germination was slowed in sdp1 sdp1L and postgerminative seedling growth was severely retarded. The frequency of seedling establishment was also reduced, but sdp1 sdp1L was not seedling lethal under normal laboratory growth conditions. Our data show that together SDP1 and SDP1L account for at least 95\% of the rate of TAG hydrolysis in Arabidopsis seeds, and that this hydrolysis is important but not essential for seed germination or seedling establishment.},

abstract = {In seeds, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) operates at the metabolic nexus between carbon and nitrogen metabolism by catalyzing the unidirectional decarboxylation of glutamate to form $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA). To elucidate the regulatory role of GAD in seed development, we generated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic plants expressing a truncated GAD from Petunia hybrida missing the carboxyl-terminal regulatory Ca(2+)-calmodulin-binding domain under the transcriptional regulation of the seed maturation-specific phaseolin promoter. Dry seeds of the transgenic plants accumulated considerable amounts of GABA, and during desiccation the content of several amino acids increased, although not glutamate or proline. Dry transgenic seeds had higher protein content than wild-type seeds but lower amounts of the intermediates of glycolysis, glycerol and malate. The total fatty acid content of the transgenic seeds was 50\% lower than in the wild type, while acyl-coenzyme A accumulated in the transgenic seeds. Labeling experiments revealed altered levels of respiration in the transgenic seeds, and fractionation studies indicated reduced incorporation of label in the sugar and lipid fractions extracted from transgenic seeds. Comparative transcript profiling of the dry seeds supported the metabolic data. Cellular processes up-regulated at the transcript level included the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid elongation, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, nitrogen-carbon remobilization, and programmed cell death. Genes involved in the regulation of germination were similarly up-regulated. Taken together, these results indicate that the GAD-mediated conversion of glutamate to GABA during seed development plays an important role in balancing carbon and nitrogen metabolism and in storage reserve accumulation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sample mix-ups can arise during sample collection, handling, genotyping or data management. It is unclear how often sample mix-ups occur in genome-wide studies, as there currently are no post hoc methods that can identify these mix-ups in unrelated samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm (MixupMapper) that can both detect and correct sample mix-ups in genome-wide studies that study gene expression levels. RESULTS: We applied MixupMapper to five publicly available human genetical genomics datasets. On average, 3\% of all analyzed samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes: in one of the datasets 23\% of the samples had incorrect expression phenotypes. The consequences of sample mix-ups are substantial: when we corrected these sample mix-ups, we identified on average 15\% more significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). In one dataset, we identified three times as many significant cis-eQTLs after correction. Furthermore, we show through simulations that sample mix-ups can lead to an underestimation of the explained heritability of complex traits in genome-wide association datasets.

A large number of unique COL7A1 mutations have been shown to underlie DEB. Although general genotype-phenotype correlation rules have emerged, many exceptions to these rules exist, compromising disease diagnosing and genetic counseling. We therefore constructed the International DEB Patient Registry (http://www.deb-central.org), aimed at worldwide collection and sharing of phenotypic and genotypic information on DEB. As of May 2011, this MOLGENIS-based registry contains detailed information on 508 published and 71 unpublished patients and their 388 unique COL7A1 mutations, and includes all combinations of mutations. The current registry RDEB versus DDEB ratio of 4:1, if compared to prevalence figures, suggests underreporting of DDEB in the literature. Thirty-eight percent of mutations stored introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) and 43\% an amino acid change. Submission wizards allow users to quickly and easily share novel information. This registry will be of great help in disease diagnosing and genetic counseling and will lead to novel insights, especially in the rare phenotypes of which there is often lack of understanding.

abstract = {Plant growth and development is profoundly influenced by environmental conditions that laboratory experimentation typically attempts to control. However, growth conditions are not uniform between or even within laboratories and the extent to which these differences influence plant growth and development is unknown. Experiments with wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana were designed to quantify the influences of parental environment and seed size on growth and development in the next generation. A single lot of seed was planted in six environmental chambers and grown to maturity. The seed produced was mechanically sieved into small and large size classes then grown in a common environment and subjected to a set of assays spanning the life cycle. Analysis of variance demonstrated that seed size effects were particularly significant early in development, affecting primary root growth and gravitropism, but also flowering time. Parental environment affected progeny germination time, flowering and weight of seed the progeny produced. In some cases, the parental environment affected the magnitude of (interacted with) the observed seed size effects. These data indicate that life history circumstances of the parental generation can affect growth and development throughout the life cycle of the next generation to an extent that should be considered when performing genetic studies.},

abstract = {Traditional methods for detecting genes that affect complex diseases in humans or animal models, milk production in livestock, or other traits of interest, have asked whether variation in genotype produces a change in that trait's average value. But focusing on differences in the mean ignores differences in variability about that mean. The robustness, or uniformity, of an individual's character is not only of great practical importance in medical genetics and food production but is also of scientific and evolutionary interest (e.g., blood pressure in animal models of heart disease, litter size in pigs, flowering time in plants). We describe a method for detecting major genes controlling the phenotypic variance, referring to these as vQTL. Our method uses a double generalized linear model with linear predictors based on probabilities of line origin. We evaluate our method on simulated F₂ and collaborative cross data, and on a real F₂ intercross, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness to the presence of ordinary mean-controlling QTL. We also illustrate the connection between vQTL and QTL involved in epistasis, explaining how these concepts overlap. Our method can be applied to a wide range of commonly used experimental crosses and may be extended to genetic association more generally.},

abstract = {For many complex traits, genetic variants have been found associated. However, it is still mostly unclear through which downstream mechanism these variants cause these phenotypes. Knowledge of these intermediate steps is crucial to understand pathogenesis, while also providing leads for potential pharmacological intervention. Here we relied upon natural human genetic variation to identify effects of these variants on trans-gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus mapping, eQTL) in whole peripheral blood from 1,469 unrelated individuals. We looked at 1,167 published trait- or disease-associated SNPs and observed trans-eQTL effects on 113 different genes, of which we replicated 46 in monocytes of 1,490 different individuals and 18 in a smaller dataset that comprised subcutaneous adipose, visceral adipose, liver tissue, and muscle tissue. HLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 10-fold enriched for trans-eQTLs: 48\% of the trans-acting SNPs map within the HLA, including ulcerative colitis susceptibility variants that affect plausible candidate genes AOAH and TRBV18 in trans. We identified 18 pairs of unlinked SNPs associated with the same phenotype and affecting expression of the same trans-gene (21 times more than expected, P<10(-16)). This was particularly pronounced for mean platelet volume (MPV): Two independent SNPs significantly affect the well-known blood coagulation genes GP9 and F13A1 but also C19orf33, SAMD14, VCL, and GNG11. Several of these SNPs have a substantially higher effect on the downstream trans-genes than on the eventual phenotypes, supporting the concept that the effects of these SNPs on expression seems to be much less multifactorial. Therefore, these trans-eQTLs could well represent some of the intermediate genes that connect genetic variants with their eventual complex phenotypic outcomes.},

@article{Chan:2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association (GWA) is gaining popularity as a means to study the architecture of complex quantitative traits, partially due to the improvement of high-throughput low-cost genotyping and phenotyping technologies. Glucosinolate (GSL) secondary metabolites within Arabidopsis spp. can serve as a model system to understand the genomic architecture of adaptive quantitative traits. GSL are key anti-herbivory defenses that impart adaptive advantages within field trials. While little is known about how variation in the external or internal environment of an organism may influence the efficiency of GWA, GSL variation is known to be highly dependent upon the external stresses and developmental processes of the plant lending it to be an excellent model for studying conditional GWA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To understand how development and environment can influence GWA, we conducted a study using 96 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, >40 GSL phenotypes across three conditions (one developmental comparison and one environmental comparison) and ∼230,000 SNPs. Developmental stage had dramatic effects on the outcome of GWA, with each stage identifying different loci associated with GSL traits. Further, while the molecular bases of numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling GSL traits have been identified, there is currently no estimate of how many additional genes may control natural variation in these traits. We developed a novel co-expression network approach to prioritize the thousands of GWA candidates and successfully validated a large number of these genes as influencing GSL accumulation within A. thaliana using single gene isogenic lines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results suggest that complex traits imparting environmentally contingent adaptive advantages are likely influenced by up to thousands of loci that are sensitive to fluctuations in the environment or developmental state of the organism. Additionally, while GWA is highly conditional upon genetics, the use of additional genomic information can rapidly identify causal loci en masse.},

abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae is an emerging model organism that allows evolutionary comparisons with C. elegans and exploration of its own unique biological attributes. To produce a high-resolution C. briggsae recombination map, recombinant inbred lines were generated from reciprocal crosses between two strains and genotyped at over 1,000 loci. A second set of recombinant inbred lines involving a third strain was also genotyped at lower resolution. The resulting recombination maps exhibit discrete domains of high and low recombination, as in C. elegans, indicating these are a general feature of Caenorhabditis species. The proportion of a chromosome's physical size occupied by the central, low-recombination domain is highly correlated between species. However, the C. briggsae intra-species comparison reveals striking variation in the distribution of recombination between domains. Hybrid lines made with the more divergent pair of strains also exhibit pervasive marker transmission ratio distortion, evidence of selection acting on hybrid genotypes. The strongest effect, on chromosome III, is explained by a developmental delay phenotype exhibited by some hybrid F2 animals. In addition, on chromosomes IV and V, cross direction-specific biases towards one parental genotype suggest the existence of cytonuclear epistatic interactions. These interactions are discussed in relation to surprising mitochondrial genome polymorphism in C. briggsae, evidence that the two strains diverged in allopatry, the potential for local adaptation, and the evolution of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. The genetic and genomic resources resulting from this work will support future efforts to understand inter-strain divergence as well as facilitate studies of gene function, natural variation, and the evolution of recombination in Caenorhabditis nematodes.},

abstract = {Quantitative trait loci (QTL) hotspots (genomic locations affecting many traits) are a common feature in genetical genomics studies and are biologically interesting since they may harbor critical regulators. Therefore, statistical procedures to assess the significance of hotspots are of key importance. One approach, randomly allocating observed QTL across the genomic locations separately by trait, implicitly assumes all traits are uncorrelated. Recently, an empirical test for QTL hotspots was proposed on the basis of the number of traits that exceed a predetermined LOD value, such as the standard permutation LOD threshold. The permutation null distribution of the maximum number of traits across all genomic locations preserves the correlation structure among the phenotypes, avoiding the detection of spurious hotspots due to nongenetic correlation induced by uncontrolled environmental factors and unmeasured variables. However, by considering only the number of traits above a threshold, without accounting for the magnitude of the LOD scores, relevant information is lost. In particular, biologically interesting hotspots composed of a moderate to small number of traits with strong LOD scores may be neglected as nonsignificant. In this article we propose a quantile-based permutation approach that simultaneously accounts for the number and the LOD scores of traits within the hotspots. By considering a sliding scale of mapping thresholds, our method can assess the statistical significance of both small and large hotspots. Although the proposed approach can be applied to any type of heritable high-volume "omic" data set, we restrict our attention to expression (e)QTL analysis. We assess and compare the performances of these three methods in simulations and we illustrate how our approach can effectively assess the significance of moderate and small hotspots with strong LOD scores in a yeast expression data set.},

abstract = {In order to contribute to the inventory of genomic areas involved in maize cell wall lignification and degradability, QTL analyses were investigated in a RIL progeny between an old Minnesota13 dent line (WM13) and a modern Iodent line (RIo). Significant variation for agronomic- and cell wall-related traits was observed for the RIL per se (plants without ears) and topcross (whole plants) experiments after crossing with both old (Ia153) and modern tester (RFl) lines. Three QTLs for stover (plant without ear) yield were observed in per se experiments, with alleles increasing yield originating from RIo in two genomic locations with the highest effects. However, no QTL for whole plant yield was detected in topcross experiments, despite the fact that two QTLs for starch content were shown with increasing alleles originating from the modern RIo line. Fifteen lignin QTLs were shown, including a QTL for Klason lignins in per se experiments, located in bin 2.04, which explained 43 \% of the observed genetic variation. Thirteen QTLs for p-hydroxycinnamic acid contents and nine QTLs related to the monomeric composition of lignin were shown in per se experiments, with syringaldehyde and diferulate QTLs explaining nearly 25 \% of trait variations. Nine and seven QTLs for cell wall digestibility were mapped in per se and topcross experiments, respectively. Five of the per se QTLs explained more than 15 \% of the variation, up to nearly 25 \%. QTL positions in bins 2.06, 5.04, 5.08 and 8.02 for ADL/NDF, IVNDFD, lignin structure and/or p-hydroxycinnamic acid contents have not been previously shown and were thus first identified in the RIo × WM13 progeny. Based on QTL colocalizations, differences in cell wall degradability between RIo and WM13 were less often related to acid detergent lignin (ADL) content than in previous RIL investigations. QTL colocalizations then highlighted the probable importance of ferulate cross linkages in variation for cell wall digestibility. No colocalizations of QTL for cell wall phenolic-related traits were shown with genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis or polymerization. In contrast, colocalizations were most often shown with MYB and NAC transcription factors, including orthologs of master genes involved in Arabidopsis secondary wall assembly. QTL colocalizations also strengthened the probable involvement of members of the CoA-dependent acyltransferase PF02458 family in the feruloylation of arabinoxylan chains.},

Notably, C. elegans genome variation is dominated by a set of commonly shared haplotypes on four of its six chromosomes, each spanning many megabases. Population genetic modeling showed that this pattern was generated by chromosome-scale selective sweeps that have reduced variation worldwide; at least one of these sweeps probably occurred in the last few hundred years. These sweeps, which we hypothesize to be a result of human activity, have drastically reshaped the global C. elegans population in the recent past.},

The group evaluated interoperability and performed initial feasibility studies. To aid future compatibility of software and exchange of already developed software modules, a strong recommendation was made by the group to integrate HAPPY and R/qtl analysis toolboxes, GeneNetwork and XGAP database platforms, and TIQS and xQTL processing platforms. R should be used as the principal computer language for QTL data analysis in all platforms and a 'cloud' should be used for software dissemination to the community. Furthermore, the working group recommended that all data models and software source code should be made visible in public repositories to allow a coordinated effort on the use of common data structures and file formats.},

@article{Rausch2012,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of genomic structural variants (SVs) at high sensitivity and specificity is an essential requirement for characterizing naturally occurring variation and for understanding pathological somatic rearrangements in personal genome sequencing data. Of particular interest are integrated methods that accurately identify simple and complex rearrangements in heterogeneous sequencing datasets at single-nucleotide resolution, as an optimal basis for investigating the formation mechanisms and functional consequences of SVs. RESULTS: We have developed an SV discovery method, called DELLY, that integrates short insert paired-ends, long-range mate-pairs and split-read alignments to accurately delineate genomic rearrangements at single-nucleotide resolution. DELLY is suitable for detecting copy-number variable deletion and tandem duplication events as well as balanced rearrangements such as inversions or reciprocal translocations. DELLY, thus, enables to ascertain the full spectrum of genomic rearrangements, including complex events. On simulated data, DELLY compares favorably to other SV prediction methods across a wide range of sequencing parameters. On real data, DELLY reliably uncovers SVs from the 1000 Genomes Project and cancer genomes, and validation experiments of randomly selected deletion loci show a high specificity. AVAILABILITY: DELLY is available at www.korbel.embl.de/software.html CONTACT: tobias.rausch@embl.de.},

abstract = {Genetical genomics combines acquired high-throughput genomic data with genetic analysis. In this chapter, we discuss the application of genetical genomics for evolutionary studies, where new high-throughput molecular technologies are combined with mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the genome in segregating populations.The recent explosion of high-throughput data--measuring thousands of proteins and metabolites, deep sequencing, chromatin, and methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation--allows the study of the genetic variation underlying quantitative phenotypes, together termed xQTL. At the same time, mining information is not getting easier. To deal with the sheer amount of information, powerful statistical tools are needed to analyze multidimensional relationships. In the context of evolutionary computational biology, a well-designed experiment may help dissect a complex evolutionary trait using proven statistical methods for associating phenotypical variation with genomic locations.Evolutionary expression QTL (eQTL) studies of the last years focus on gene expression adaptations, mapping the gene expression landscape, and, tentatively, eQTL networks. Here, we discuss the possibility of introducing an evolutionary prior, in the form of gene families displaying evidence of positive selection, and using that in the context of an eQTL experiment for elucidating host-pathogen protein-protein interactions. Through the example of an experimental design, we discuss the choice of xQTL platform, analysis methods, and scope of results. The resulting eQTL can be matched, resulting in putative interacting genes and their regulators. In addition, a prior may help distinguish QTL causality from reactivity, or independence of traits, by creating QTL networks.},

abstract = {Graphical models describe the linear correlation structure of data and have been used to establish causal relationships among phenotypes in genetic mapping populations. Data are typically collected at a single point in time. Biological processes on the other hand are often non-linear and display time varying dynamics. The extent to which graphical models can recapitulate the architecture of an underlying biological processes is not well understood. We consider metabolic networks with known stoichiometry to address the fundamental question: "What can causal networks tell us about metabolic pathways?". Using data from an Arabidopsis Bay[Formula: see text]Sha population and simulated data from dynamic models of pathway motifs, we assess our ability to reconstruct metabolic pathways using graphical models. Our results highlight the necessity of non-genetic residual biological variation for reliable inference. Recovery of the ordering within a pathway is possible, but should not be expected. Causal inference is sensitive to subtle patterns in the correlation structure that may be driven by a variety of factors, which may not emphasize the substrate-product relationship. We illustrate the effects of metabolic pathway architecture, epistasis and stochastic variation on correlation structure and graphical model-derived networks. We conclude that graphical models should be interpreted cautiously, especially if the implied causal relationships are to be used in the design of intervention strategies.},

It is the final, internal product of chemical interactions, obtained through developmental, genetic, and environmental inputs, and as such, it defines the state of a plant in terms of development and performance. Understanding its regulation will provide knowledge and new insights into the biochemical pathways and genetic interactions that shape the plant and its surroundings. In this review, we will focus on four dimensions that contribute to the huge diversity of metabolomes and we will illustrate how this diversity shapes the plant in terms of development and performance: (i) temporal regulation: the metabolome is extremely dynamic and temporal changes in the environment can have an immense impact on its composition; (ii) spatial regulation: metabolites can be very specific, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, to specialized organs, tissues, and cell types; (iii) environmental regulation: the metabolic profile of plants is highly dependent on environmental signals, such as light, temperature, and nutrients, and very susceptible to biotic and abiotic stresses; and (iv) genetic regulation: the biosynthesis, structure, and accumulation of metabolites have a genetic origin, and there is quantitative and qualitative variation for metabolomes within a species. We will address the contribution of these dimensions to the wide diversity of metabolomes and highlight how the multi-dimensional regulation of metabolism defines the plant's phenotype.},

abstract = {Microarray profiling of gene expression is widely applied in molecular biology and functional genomics. Experimental and technical variations make meta-analysis of different studies challenging. In a total of 3358 samples, all from German population-based cohorts, we investigated the effect of data preprocessing and the variability due to sample processing in whole blood cell and blood monocyte gene expression data, measured on the Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 BeadChip array.Gene expression signal intensities were similar after applying the log(2) or the variance-stabilizing transformation. In all cohorts, the first principal component (PC) explained more than 95\% of the total variation. Technical factors substantially influenced signal intensity values, especially the Illumina chip assignment (33-48\% of the variance), the RNA amplification batch (12-24\%), the RNA isolation batch (16\%), and the sample storage time, in particular the time between blood donation and RNA isolation for the whole blood cell samples (2-3\%), and the time between RNA isolation and amplification for the monocyte samples (2\%). White blood cell composition parameters were the strongest biological factors influencing the expression signal intensities in the whole blood cell samples (3\%), followed by sex (1-2\%) in both sample types. Known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in 38\% of the analyzed probe sequences and 4\% of them included common SNPs (minor allele frequency >5\%). Out of the tested SNPs, 1.4\% significantly modified the probe-specific expression signals (Bonferroni corrected p-value<0.05), but in almost half of these events the signal intensities were even increased despite the occurrence of the mismatch. Thus, the vast majority of SNPs within probes had no significant effect on hybridization efficiency.In summary, adjustment for a few selected technical factors greatly improved reliability of gene expression analyses. Such adjustments are particularly required for meta-analyses.},

abstract = {Perfect timing of germination is required to encounter optimal conditions for plant survival and is the result of a complex interaction between molecular processes, seed characteristics, and environmental cues. To detangle these processes, we made use of natural genetic variation present in an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Bayreuth × Shahdara recombinant inbred line population. For a detailed analysis of the germination response, we characterized rate, uniformity, and maximum germination and discuss the added value of such precise measurements. The effects of after-ripening, stratification, and controlled deterioration as well as the effects of salt, mannitol, heat, cold, and abscisic acid (ABA) with and without cold stratification were analyzed for these germination characteristics. Seed morphology (size and length) of both dry and imbibed seeds was quantified by using image analysis. For the overwhelming amount of data produced in this study, we developed new approaches to perform and visualize high-throughput quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. We show correlation of trait data, (shared) QTL positions, and epistatic interactions. The detection of similar loci for different stresses indicates that, often, the molecular processes regulating environmental responses converge into similar pathways. Seven major QTL hotspots were confirmed using a heterogeneous inbred family approach. QTLs colocating with previously reported QTLs and well-characterized mutants are discussed. A new connection between dormancy, ABA, and a cripple mucilage formation due to a naturally occurring mutation in the MUCILAGE-MODIFIED2 gene is proposed, and this is an interesting lead for further research on the regulatory role of ABA in mucilage production and its multiple effects on germination parameters.},

Small-molecule metabolites are one category of critical cellular intermediates that can influence as well as be a target of cellular regulations. Because metabolites represent the direct output of protein-mediated cellular processes, endogenous metabolite concentrations can closely reflect cellular physiological states, especially when integrated with other molecular-profiling data. Here we develop and apply a network reconstruction approach that simultaneously integrates six different types of data: endogenous metabolite concentration, RNA expression, DNA variation, DNA-protein binding, protein-metabolite interaction, and protein-protein interaction data, to construct probabilistic causal networks that elucidate the complexity of cell regulation in a segregating yeast population. Because many of the metabolites are found to be under strong genetic control, we were able to employ a causal regulator detection algorithm to identify causal regulators of the resulting network that elucidated the mechanisms by which variations in their sequence affect gene expression and metabolite concentrations. We examined all four expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hot spots with colocalized metabolite QTLs, two of which recapitulated known biological processes, while the other two elucidated novel putative biological mechanisms for the eQTL hot spots.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that genetic risk factors for common disease are caused by hereditary changes of gene regulation acting in complex pathways. Clearly understanding the molecular genetic relationships between genetic control of gene expression and its effect on complex diseases is essential. Here we describe the Brisbane Systems Genetics Study (BSGS), a family-based study that will be used to elucidate the genetic factors affecting gene expression and the role of gene regulation in mediating endophenotypes and complex diseases.BSGS comprises of a total of 962 individuals from 314 families, for which we have high-density genotype, gene expression and phenotypic data. Families consist of combinations of both monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, their siblings, and, for 72 families, both parents. A significant advantage of the inclusion of parents is improved power to disentangle environmental, additive genetic and non-additive genetic effects of gene expression and measured phenotypes. Furthermore, it allows for the estimation of parent-of-origin effects, something that has not previously been systematically investigated in human genetical genomics studies. Measured phenotypes available within the BSGS include blood phenotypes and biochemical traits measured from components of the tissue sample in which transcription levels are determined, providing an ideal test case for systems genetics approaches.We report results from an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis using 862 individuals from BSGS to test for associations between expression levels of 17,926 probes and 528,509 SNP genotypes. At a study wide significance level approximately 15,000 associations were observed between expression levels and SNP genotypes. These associations corresponded to a total of 2,081 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) involving 1,503 probes. The majority of identified eQTL (87\%) were located within cis-regions.},

abstract = {One of the major goals of quantitative genetics is to unravel the complex interactions between molecular genetic factors and the environment. The effects of these genotype-by-environment interactions also affect and cause variation in gene expression. The regulatory loci responsible for this variation can be found by genetical genomics that involves the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for gene expression traits also called expression-QTL (eQTLs). Most genetical genomics experiments published so far, are performed in a single environment and hence do not allow investigation of the role of genotype-by-environment interactions. Furthermore, most studies have been done in a steady state environment leading to acclimated expression patterns. However a response to the environment or change therein can be highly plastic and possibly lead to more and larger differences between genotypes. Here we present a genetical genomics study on 120 Arabidopsis thaliana, Landsberg erecta × Cape Verde Islands, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in active response to the environment by treating them with 3 h of shade. The results of this experiment are compared to a previous study on seedlings of the same RILs from a steady state environment. The combination of two highly different conditions but exactly the same RILs with a fixed genetic variation showed the large role of genotype-by-environment interactions on gene expression levels. We found environment-dependent hotspots of transcript regulation. The major hotspot was confirmed by the expression profile of a near isogenic line. Our combined analysis leads us to propose CSN5A, a COP9 signalosome component, as a candidate regulator for the gene expression response to shade.},

abstract = {Genomic data analysis in evolutionary biology is becoming so computationally intensive that analysis of multiple hypotheses and scenarios takes too long on a single desktop computer. In this chapter, we discuss techniques for scaling computations through parallelization of calculations, after giving a quick overview of advanced programming techniques. Unfortunately, parallel programming is difficult and requires special software design. The alternative, especially attractive for legacy software, is to introduce poor man's parallelization by running whole programs in parallel as separate processes, using job schedulers. Such pipelines are often deployed on bioinformatics computer clusters. Recent advances in PC virtualization have made it possible to run a full computer operating system, with all of its installed software, on top of another operating system, inside a "box," or virtual machine (VM). Such a VM can flexibly be deployed on multiple computers, in a local network, e.g., on existing desktop PCs, and even in the Cloud, to create a "virtual" computer cluster. Many bioinformatics applications in evolutionary biology can be run in parallel, running processes in one or more VMs. Here, we show how a ready-made bioinformatics VM image, named BioNode, effectively creates a computing cluster, and pipeline, in a few steps. This allows researchers to scale-up computations from their desktop, using available hardware, anytime it is required. BioNode is based on Debian Linux and can run on networked PCs and in the Cloud. Over 200 bioinformatics and statistical software packages, of interest to evolutionary biology, are included, such as PAML, Muscle, MAFFT, MrBayes, and BLAST. Most of these software packages are maintained through the Debian Med project. In addition, BioNode contains convenient configuration scripts for parallelizing bioinformatics software. Where Debian Med encourages packaging free and open source bioinformatics software through one central project, BioNode encourages creating free and open source VM images, for multiple targets, through one central project. BioNode can be deployed on Windows, OSX, Linux, and in the Cloud. Next to the downloadable BioNode images, we provide tutorials online, which empower bioinformaticians to install and run BioNode in different environments, as well as information for future initiatives, on creating and building such images.},

abstract = {The number and distribution of gene expression QTL (eQTL) represent the genetic architecture of many complex traits, including common human diseases. We previously reported that the heritable eQTL patterns are highly dynamic with age in an N2 × CB4856 recombinant inbred population of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, we showed that the number of eQTL decreased with age. Here, we investigated the reason for this decrease by combining gene expression profiles at three ages in the wild types N2 and CB4856 with the reported expression profiles of the RIL population. We determined heritability and transgression (when gene expression levels in the RILs are more extreme than the parents) and investigated their relation with eQTL changes with age. Transgressive segregation was widespread but depended on physiological age. The percentage of genes with an eQTL increased with a higher heritability in young worms. However, for old worms this percentage hardly increased. Using a single marker approach, we found that almost 20\% of genes with heritability >0.9 had an eQTL in developing worms. Surprisingly, only 10\% was found in old worms. Using a multimarker approach, this percentage increased to almost 30\% for both age groups. Comparison of the single marker to a multiple marker eQTL mapping indicated that heritable regulation of gene expression becomes more polygenic in aging worms due to multiple loci and possible epistatic interactions. We conclude that linkage studies should account for the relation between increased polygenic regulation and diminished effects at older ages.},

abstract = {Increased lifespan can be associated with greater resistance to many different stressors, most notably thermal stress. Such hormetic effects have also been found in C. elegans where short-term exposure to heat lengthens the lifespan. Genetic investigations have been carried out using mutation perturbations in a single genotype, the wild type Bristol N2. Yet, induced mutations do not yield insight regarding the natural genetic variation of thermal tolerance and lifespan. We investigated the genetic variation of heat-shock recovery, i.e. hormetic effects on lifespan and associated quantitative trait loci (QTL) in C. elegans. Heat-shock resulted in an 18\% lifespan increase in wild type CB4856 whereas N2 did not show a lifespan elongation. Using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wild types N2 and CB4856 we found natural variation in stress-response hormesis in lifespan. Approx. 28\% of the RILs displayed a hormesis effect in lifespan. We did not find any hormesis effects for total offspring. Across the RILs there was no relation between lifespan and offspring. The ability to recover from heat-shock mapped to a significant QTL on chromosome II which overlapped with a QTL for offspring under heat-shock conditions. The QTL was confirmed by introgressing relatively small CB4856 regions into chromosome II of N2. Our observations show that there is natural variation in hormetic effects on C. elegans lifespan for heat-shock and that this variation is genetically determined.},

abstract = {It is known that genetic variants can affect gene expression, but it is not yet completely clear through what mechanisms genetic variation mediate this expression. We therefore compared the cis-effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression between blood samples from 1,240 human subjects and four primary non-blood tissues (liver, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) from 85 subjects. We characterized four different mechanisms for 2,072 probes that show tissue-dependent genetic regulation between blood and non-blood tissues: on average 33.2\% only showed cis-regulation in non-blood tissues; 14.5\% of the eQTL probes were regulated by different, independent SNPs depending on the tissue of investigation. 47.9\% showed a different effect size although they were regulated by the same SNPs. Surprisingly, we observed that 4.4\% were regulated by the same SNP but with opposite allelic direction. We show here that SNPs that are located in transcriptional regulatory elements are enriched for tissue-dependent regulation, including SNPs at 3' and 5' untranslated regions (P = 1.84×10(-5) and 4.7×10(-4), respectively) and SNPs that are synonymous-coding (P = 9.9×10(-4)). SNPs that are associated with complex traits more often exert a tissue-dependent effect on gene expression (P = 2.6×10(-10)). Our study yields new insights into the genetic basis of tissue-dependent expression and suggests that complex trait associated genetic variants have even more complex regulatory effects than previously anticipated.},

abstract = {Iron (Fe) deficiency is a world-wide nutritional disorder in both plants and humans, resulting from its restricted bioavailability for plants and, subsequently, low Fe concentration in edible plant parts. Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to alleviate Fe deficiency, with the aim of recalibrating metabolic fluxes and maintaining cellular Fe homeostasis. To analyze condition-sensitive changes in precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing pattern, we mapped the transcriptome of Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots using the RNA sequencing technology and a newly developed software toolbox, the Read Analysis \& Comparison Kit in Java (RACKJ). In alternatively spliced genes, stress-related Gene Ontology categories were overrepresented, while housekeeping cellular functions were mainly transcriptionally controlled. Fe deficiency increased the complexity of the splicing pattern and triggered the differential alternative splicing of 313 genes, the majority of which had differentially retained introns. Several genes with important functions in Fe acquisition and homeostasis were both differentially expressed and differentially alternatively spliced upon Fe deficiency, indicating a complex regulation of gene activity in Fe-deficient conditions. A comparison with a data set for phosphate-deficient plants suggests that changes in splicing patterns are nutrient specific and not or not chiefly caused by stochastic fluctuations. In sum, our analysis identified extensive posttranscriptional control, biasing the abundance and activity of proteins in a condition-dependent manner. The production of a mixture of functional and nonfunctional transcripts may provide a means to fine-tune the abundance of transcripts with critical importance in cellular Fe homeostasis. It is assumed that differential gene expression and nutrient deficiency-induced changes in pre-mRNA splicing represent parallel, but potentially interacting, regulatory mechanisms.},

The classical methods used to determine RNA quality are based on electrophoresis and spectrophotometer assessment, namely A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios. It was previously shown that due to the complex nature of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, RNA extraction procedures could impact mRNA quality and thus accurate quantification. Herein, we contaminated and degraded RNA extracted from S. epidermidis biofilms, and assessed the effect on gene expression by qPCR. As expected, thermal degradation of RNA had a significant impact on gene expression on two out of the three tested genes. On the other hand, the contamination of the extracted RNA yielded an interesting result: while most contaminants did not changed the purity indicators or the integrity of RNA, significant changes on gene expression levels were found. This work confirms that poor RNA extraction has an important impact in qPCR quantification, emphasizing the consequences of carry-over contaminants on gene expression studies. Additionally, our results show that the parameters commonly used to assess the quality of extracted RNA from bacterial cultures seem to be insufficient to ensure reliable gene expression determination.},

Some of these SNPs affect multiple genes in trans that are known to be altered in individuals with disease: rs4917014, previously associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), altered gene expression of C1QB and five type I interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE. DeepSAGE RNA sequencing showed that rs4917014 strongly alters the 3' UTR levels of IKZF1 in cis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analysis of the trans-regulated genes implicated IKZF1 as the causal gene.

The most recent estimates, based on whole transcriptome sequencing, indicate that about 95 \% of human and 60 \% of Arabidopsis multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing, suggesting important roles for this mechanism in biological processes. However, while the misregulation of alternative splicing has been associated with many human diseases, its biological relevance in plant systems is just beginning to unfold. We review here the few plant genes for which the production of multiple splice isoforms has been reported to have a clear in vivo functional impact. These case studies implicate alternative splicing in the control of a wide range of physiological and developmental processes, including photosynthetic and starch metabolism, hormone signaling, seed germination, root growth and flowering, as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Future functional characterization of alternative splicing events and identification of the transcripts targeted by major regulators of this versatile means of modulating gene expression should uncover the breadth of its physiological significance in higher plants.},

The use of well-structured recombinant inbred lines in combination with "omics" analysis can help to disentangle the genetic basis of such quantitative traits. This so-called genetical genomics approach can effectively capture both genetic and epistatic interactions. However, to understand how the environment interacts with genomic-encoded information, a better understanding of the perception and processing of environmental signals is needed. In a classical genetical genomics setup, this requires replication of the whole experiment in different environmental conditions. A novel generalized setup overcomes this limitation and includes environmental perturbation within a single experimental design. We developed a dedicated quantitative trait loci mapping procedure to implement this approach and used existing phenotypical data to demonstrate its power. In addition, we studied the genetic regulation of primary metabolism in dry and imbibed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. In the metabolome, many changes were observed that were under both environmental and genetic controls and their interaction. This concept offers unique reduction of experimental load with minimal compromise of statistical power and is of great potential in the field of systems genetics, which requires a broad understanding of both plasticity and dynamic regulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA and microarray quality assessment form an integral part of gene expression analysis and, although methods such as the RNA integrity number (RIN) algorithm reliably asses RNA integrity, the relevance of RNA integrity in gene expression analysis as well as analysis methods to accommodate the possible effects of degradation requires further investigation. We investigated the relationship between RNA integrity and array quality on the commonly used Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST array platform using reliable within-array and between-array quality assessment measures. The possibility of a transcript specific bias in the apparent effect of RNA degradation on the measured gene expression signal was evaluated after either excluding quality-flagged arrays or compensation for RNA degradation at different steps in the analysis. RESULTS: Using probe-level and inter-array quality metrics to assess 34 Gene 1.0 ST array datasets derived from historical, paired tumour and normal primary colorectal cancer samples, 7 arrays (20.6\%), with a mean sample RIN of 3.2 (SD = 0.42), were flagged during array quality assessment while 10 arrays from samples with RINs < 7 passed quality assessment, including one sample with a RIN < 3. We detected a transcript length bias in RNA degradation in only 5.8\% of annotated transcript clusters (p-value 0.05, FC ≥ |2|), with longer and shorter than average transcripts under- and overrepresented in quality-flagged samples respectively. Applying compensatory measures for RNA degradation performed at least as well as excluding quality-flagged arrays, as judged by hierarchical clustering, gene expression analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; importantly, use of these compensatory measures had the significant benefit of enabling lower quality array data from irreplaceable clinical samples to be retained in downstream analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate an effective array-quality assessment strategy, which will allow the user to recognize lower quality arrays that can be included in the analysis once appropriate measures are applied to account for known or unknown sources of variation, such as array quality- and batch- effects, by implementing ComBat or Surrogate Variable Analysis. This approach of quality control and analysis will be especially useful for clinical samples with variable and low RNA qualities, with RIN scores ≥ 2.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered susceptibility loci for a large number of complex traits. Functional interpretation of candidate genes identified by GWAS and confident assignment of the causal variant still remains a major challenge. Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping has facilitated identification of risk loci for quantitative traits and might allow prioritization of GWAS candidate genes. One major challenge of eQTL studies is the need for larger sample numbers and replication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of whole-blood eQTLs in humans and test their value in the identification of putative functional variants involved in the etiology of complex traits. In the current study, we performed comphrehensive eQTL mapping from whole blood. The discovery sample included 322 Caucasians from a general population sample (KORA F3). We identified 363 cis and 8 trans eQTLs after stringent Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Of these, 98.6\% and 50\% of cis and trans eQTLs, respectively, could be replicated in two independent populations (KORA F4 (n=740) and SHIP-TREND (n=653)). Furthermore, we identified evidence of regulatory variation for SNPs previously reported to be associated with disease loci (n=59) or quantitative trait loci (n=20), indicating a possible functional mechanism for these eSNPs. Our data demonstrate that eQTLs in whole blood are highly robust and reproducible across studies and highlight the relevance of whole-blood eQTL mapping in prioritization of GWAS candidate genes in humans.},

The underlying genetic architecture of natural genetic variation in dauer formation has, however, not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report extensive natural genetic variation in dauer larvae development within growing populations across multiple wild isolates. Moreover, bin mapping of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the genetically divergent isolates N2 and CB4856 reveals 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting dauer formation. Comparison of individual ILs to N2 identifies an additional eight QTLs, and sequential IL analysis reveals six more QTLs. Our results also show that a behavioural, laboratory-derived, mutation controlled by the neuropeptide Y receptor homolog npr-1 can affect dauer larvae development in growing populations. These findings illustrate the complex genetic architecture of variation in dauer larvae formation in C. elegans and may help to understand how the control of variation in dauer larvae development has evolved.},

abstract = {Large-scale "omics" data, such as microarrays, can be used to infer underlying cellular regulatory networks in organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based "eigen-molecules" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates. The package can be downloaded from the following website: http://diffcorr.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {Abstract The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit assembly that appears to be required for regulating expression of most RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcripts, which include protein-coding and most non-coding RNA genes. Mediator and pol II function within the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which consists of Mediator, pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH and is approximately 4.0 MDa in size. Mediator serves as a central scaffold within the PIC and helps regulate pol II activity in ways that remain poorly understood. Mediator is also generally targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) that work to control gene expression programs in response to developmental or environmental cues. At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from TFs directly to the pol II enzyme, thereby facilitating TF-dependent regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by TFs) to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression). In this review, we summarize an expansive body of research on the Mediator complex, with an emphasis on yeast and mammalian complexes. We focus on the basics that underlie Mediator function, such as its structure and subunit composition, and describe its broad regulatory influence on gene expression, ranging from chromatin architecture to transcription initiation and elongation, to mRNA processing. We also describe factors that influence Mediator structure and activity, including TFs, non-coding RNAs and the CDK8 module.},

@article{Dubrovina2013,
abstract = {Plants are sessile organisms capable of adapting to various environmental constraints, such as high or low temperatures, drought, soil salinity, or pathogen attack. To survive the unfavorable conditions, plants actively employ pre-mRNA splicing as a mechanism to regulate expression of stress-responsive genes and reprogram intracellular regulatory networks. There is a growing evidence that various stresses strongly affect the frequency and diversity of alternative splicing events in the stress-responsive genes and lead to an increased accumulation of mRNAs containing premature stop codons, which in turn have an impact on plant stress response. A number of studies revealed that some mRNAs involved in plant stress response are spliced counter to the traditional conception of alternative splicing. Such noncanonical mRNA splicing events include trans-splicing, intraexonic deletions, or variations affecting multiple exons and often require short direct repeats to occur. The noncanonical alternative splicing, along with common splicing events, targets the spliced transcripts to degradation through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or leads to translation of truncated proteins. Investigation of the diversity, biological consequences, and mechanisms of the canonical and noncanonical alternative splicing events will help one to identify those transcripts which are promising for using in genetic engineering and selection of stress-tolerant plants.},

If such technical bias is correlated with the clinical variable of interest, the likelihood of identifying false positive genes is increased. Here we describe a method to visualize an expression matrix as a projection of all genes onto a plane defined by a clinical variable and a technical nuisance variable. The resulting plot indicates the extent to which each gene is correlated with the clinical variable or the technical variable. We demonstrate this method by applying it to three clinical trial microarray data sets, one of which identified genes that may have been driven by a confounding technical variable. This approach can be used as a quality control step to identify data sets that are likely to yield false positive results.},

abstract = {Genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators frequently influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To fully exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in three parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We then demonstrate that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {It has been highlighted that RNA quality and appropriate reference gene selection is crucial for the interpretation of RT-qPCR results in human placental samples. In this context we investigated the effect of RNA degradation on the mRNA abundance of seven frequently used reference genes in 119 human placental samples. Combining RNA integrity measurements, RT-qPCR analysis and mathematical modeling we found major differences regarding the effect of RNA degradation on the measured expression levels between the different reference genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a modified RNA extraction method significantly improved RNA quality and consequently increased transcript levels of all reference genes.},
