\section{Introduction}

Phenotype diversity is driven by variation at the DNA level. This variation comes from the mixing of 
DNA by and from our parents. Understanding how this variation observed at the DNA level is transfered 
and modified by signals from the enviroment is of critical importance to our understanding of 
biology. Variation observed at levels 'further away' from the genome such as: transcriptome, proteome, 
metabolome, all the way up to classical phenotypes is an complex interplay between DNA and 
environment. This interplay is challenging to unravel because of multiple factors:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Complex phenotypes arise from several genetic loci and interactions between these and the 
environment
\item The more factors involved in a phenotype, the larger the samplesize required to find genetic 
factors underlying this phenotype
\item Data collection however is limited by the resources available
\item Large scale data collection puts more demands on storage and sharing of data
\item Computational issues arise when analysing such big data sets
\item Methodological constraints and limitations
\end{itemize}

This thesis will go into these issues, and highlight the advancements made in these 
fields, but first we need to set the stage.

\subsection{Background}


\subsection{Thesis outline}

The first chapter: Pheno2Geno deals with the creation of genetic maps from large scale omics data. 
The theory of genetic map construction is ~100 years old and was invented in a time where 100 
phenotype markers were a dense genetic map. In recent years software has been developed to do these 
kinds of analysis. However looking at the software available for genetic maps construction we 
observe that many packages come from the 1980s and 1990s and have not been adapted yet to use new 
technologies such as multi threading or cluster computing. Pheno2Geno aims to provide a platform to 
cope with this avalance of big data comming in. And aims to provide easy analysis of data from 
tilling arrays, RNAseq and next generation sequencing to generate expression markers and with these 
create high density genetic maps. The Pheno2Geno package is writen in the R language for statistical 
computing, and is part of the R/qtl toolset.

The second chapter is the continuation of the Multiple QTL mapping work done by R. C. Jansen, we 
incorporated his QTL mapping method in the R/qtl package. Adding a 'new' algorithm to the QTL 
toolbox of R/qtl which aims to provide a range of QTL mapping tools based on a single datastructure. 
This allows researchers to analyse data comming from different sources or to change approaches when 
data varies in structure from trait to trait.

In the third chapter we show case our ideas for a generic storage and computation platform. Our demo 
system xQTL workbench is currently being used to run the WormQTL database. xQTL workbench allows 
users to store and share their data, but also run analysis across datasets using the power of 
distibuted computing. It comes standard with  QTL mapping tools such as: R/qtl, PLINK and qtlbim

In the last chapter we describe our latest work on using differences in correlation to generate 
interaction networks using differential correlation analysis (CTL mapping) and try to find genetic 
loci controlling these observed correlation differences. A variation on method has already proven 
valuable in discovering cell type specific eQTL effects seen in gene expression data measured in 
whole blood. Analysing interaction effects between QTL and cell type ratio can be used to assign a 
cell type to each eQTL in which it is most prominent, using this information we can look for over 
representation of cell type involved in diseases by just lookig at expression levels in whole blood.\\\\

I hope you enjoy reading this thesis as much as I enjoyed creating it during the last four years,\\\\
