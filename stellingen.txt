1) Phenotypes with major QTL can be used as markers track the flow of DNA segregation within a population, 
improve resolution of a genetic map or even derive this map de-novo. (This Thesis)

2) Pinpointing all informative recombinations improves the resolution of any genetic 
map (This Thesis)

3) R/qtl MQM provides more statistical power to detect QTLs in inbred crosses and is 
the fastest implementation of the MQM algorithm available (This Thesis)

4) Visualizations such as circle plots are a useful tool for a statistician when 
talking to a biologist (This thesis, Personal Experience)

5) A database with worm data can (surprisingly) be a valuable resource to study human diseases. (This Thesis)

6) Understanding how CTLs and environment specific QTL are caused and have their effect 
will explain some of the 'missing' heritability observed when studying complex 
phenotypes. (This Thesis)

7) Experimental validation of QTLs through the use of near isogenic lines (NILs) should be 
performed when possible, and required by journals (This thesis, Personal Opinion)

8) The collaborative cross is the best resource available to study male infertility, and as such 
has become a victim of its own success (Danny Arends & Pjotr Prins - CTC 2013 Madison)

9) Programming involves more than putting statements after each other (Personal Experience)

10) The best defence is offence, except during a (thesis) defence (Personal Opinion)

11) Standing on the shoulders of giants is only possible when one is bold enough to 
attract their attention (Philosophical)

12) Ontwikkelingen in de genetica gaan zo snel, dat men over 100 jaar de kanker medicijnen van nu 
net zo barbaars zullen vinden, als wij aderlating in de middel-eeuwen.

13) Why go through the hassle of quitting, when you can just smoke (Personal Experience)

14) 'War is not murder' (Danny Arends & Joeri van der Velde - UMCG 2013)

15) Doing a PHD is having a dream on the horizon, then trying to get there in four years 
while taking small to steps to avoid the nightmares
