\newpage

This chapter highlights the conclusions of this thesis and there is a short discussion in 
which we look forward to the future of high throughput computing in systems genetics. We 
highlight the tools created in this thesis such as Pheno2Geno in section \ref{sect:Pheno2Geno} and xQTL 
workbench (\ref{sect:xQTLworkbench}). One of our current projects a new version of R/qtl called qtlHD 
is being discussed in section \ref{sect:qtlHD}. We end this chapter by highlighting some future challenges 
and solutions to these upcoming challenges in section \ref{sect:Future}

\section{Pheno2Geno}
\label{sect:Pheno2Geno}
Generating bio markers from micro arrays, tilling arrays and RNA-seq data is possible using 
mixture models. Phenotypes showing a dichotomous 0/1 distribution with approximate equal 
proportions in, say, a RIL population can be used as genetic markers: genotypes can be 
called by connecting the 0/1 to the parental strains A/B. Such markers can then be used 
for de-novo construction of the genetic map or for saturation of a known genetic map 
\cite{West:2006, Truco:2013}.

Pheno2Geno provided highly optimized routines for generating genetics maps de-novo or to 
saturate existing genetic maps. Pheno2Geno has output structures compatible with R/qtl 
\cite{Broman:2003, Arends:2010}, which provides further facilities for QTL mapping in 
inbred populations.

With the upcoming new version of R/qtl also the Pheno2Geno package will need to be redesigned 
to accommodate new requirements. These include expected changes such as: a more standalone package, 
further optimization of parallelisation, but also support for more cross types such as 
diversity outbred and/or collaborative cross mice. 

Other more uncertain requirements which might or might not come up are: The main developer 
of Pheno2Geno is currently working on polyploid species. Due to this investment of the first 
author in polyploid crops such as potatoes and tomatoes, basic support for this could be added 
in upcoming versions of Pheno2Geno. The authors are committed to maintaining the package, 
and source code is available open source making it easier to support future new requirements.

\section{xQTL workbench}
\label{sect:xQTLworkbench}
While the xQTL workbench system described in this thesis have the ability to absorb new 
analysis methods, consideration should be given to allow high flexibility. It will be 
difficult to anticipate new demands, requirements or new developments which could provide 
a better alternative than databases for data and R for analysis \cite{Arends:2012}.

The need for reliable but flexible infrastructure in systems genetics lead to the development of 
xQTL workbench. It combines, the flexibility of the MOLGENIS generator suite \cite{Swertz:2010b} 
with the most used computational and analytical tools for systems genetics (Such as: R/qtl 
\cite{Broman:2003, Arends:2010}, Plink \cite{Purcell:2007} and many other tools). Using R as 
Esperanto between the different languages, this creates a system which systems geneticists can 
use to keep track of data generation and track their analysis. Additionally using R as computational 
back end allows researchers to contribute their methods and algorithms back to the scientific 
community by uploading them into xQTL workbench.

\subsection{wormQTL and wormQTL - Human Disease}
The current version of WormQTLHD (August 2013) is a comprehensive and compendious database that 
enables molecular model organism data to be studied in the context of human diseases. Just as with 
WormQTL \cite{Snoek:2012}, we believe that WormQTLHD will be continuously curated by the members of 
the \emph{C. elegans} community. The results of the 'broad-sweep' disease-enrichment test in 
combination with the web tool will be of special interest to researchers in the human or worm 
domain. We believe these results could also be applied to prioritize the pathogenic variants 
increasingly being produced by next-generation sequencing in diagnostic labs. Genetic variants 
affecting human genes of unknown function may have worm orthologues that are part of human-worm 
phenologs and these may reveal or imply a role in a human disease \cite{Ostlund:2014}. Thus, 
through functionally conserved networks, missing information can be inferred and candidate genes 
can be selected via model organisms \cite{vanDerVelde:2014}.

The approach of WormQTLHD is conceptually similar to that described by Smedley et al. 
\cite{Smedley:2013}. They created an automated method called PhenoDigm to provide evidence about 
gene-disease associations by analyzing phenotype information. In their case, phenotypes consist of 
a collection of ontology terms, which are aligned and scored to derive an overall phenotype-similarity score. Using this 
method, known gene-phenotype associations in model organisms (mouse, zebra-fish) can be transferred 
to other organisms such as man, and help us to understand the genetic cause of disease. This method 
works best when the model organism is physiologically close to man and has comparable classical 
phenotypes. It would therefore be less useful for \emph{C. elegans}. However, combining the molecular 
(WormQTLHD) and phenotypical (PhenoDigm) approaches results in a very powerful tool to discover 
novel gene-disease associations in man, especially when using physiologically close model organisms \cite{vanDerVelde:2014}.

We plan to further develop the WormQTLHD data and tool set. There might be more ways in which 
researchers would like to search through the large amounts of data, for example, based on custom 
lists of gene identifiers, or by combining tools such as finding QTLs within specific regions. 
The QTL plots could be improved or replaced with interactive graphs that are more informative and 
would allow the users to continue 'drilling down' in the data instead of returning to the home page 
for a new analysis with a different tool. Furthermore, we envisage close integration with other data 
sources and tools such as WormNet, R/qtl and GO Enrichment to provide even more biological context 
and analytical tools for the user.

Our new database makes this data attractive and easy-to-use for an even wider community of 
quantitative geneticists working on worms and man. We are committed to maintaining the data and 
software in the future and invite the community to add and share their new data and ideas. 

\section{R/qtlHD}
\label{sect:qtlHD}
Association and / or linkage analysis will continue to be the bread-and-butter analysis 
tool-set for systems geneticists of the future. However complex systems geneticists have 
to cope with the acquisition of data from diverse experimental designs and the analysis of 
these diverse data types. Requiring complex pipelines to analyze new complexity of the 
incoming data \cite{Trelles:2011}.

Environment x Genotype interaction analysis is also a future feature of R/qtl-HD. We looked at 
different experimental designs in in chapter \ref{sect:Metabolites} comparing three different 
designs: full block design, random design and generalized genetical genomics (GGG) design design 
\cite{Joosen:2013, Li:2009}. Besides showing that using a GGG experimental design for experiments 
gives higher statistical power to detect interactions between environmental and genetic variation 
compared to a random \cite{Joosen:2013}. We concluded that interaction models are a very powerful 
tool in understanding the complex interplay between genetics and (cellular) environments 
\cite{Joosen:2013} an should thus be considered as an important feature for a new version of the 
R/qtl software package.

Association analysis can be performed using different methods, e.g. single marker association 
mapping in outbred populations, interval mapping in inbred populations, or multiple QTL mapping. 
In this thesis we used multiple QTL mapping to find QTLs for classical traits related to 
germination of seeds in \emph{A. thaliana}. We have shown an increase in QTL detection power 
of MQM versus standard single marker QTL mapping \cite{Jansen:1994a, Joosen:2011}. This shows 
that more genetic loci are involved in germination of seeds then previously known. Additionally 
Multiple QTL mapping should be implemented into R/qtl-HD besides standard single marker mapping 
to allow more powerful detection of QTL.

Increase in data size disqualifies R as main analysis platform. R is  not be the most suitable 
platform for the analysis of next generation high throughput data. While the R environment is 
well suited to scientific computing and performing statistical analysis, when big data is involved 
it is not the fastest or most optimized language available. When dealing with high throughput 
data obtained from RNA-seq, exome sequencing or Bisulfite sequencing data size quickly become 
the limiting factor for software written in R. Because R/qtl-HD is aimed at QTL analysis of 
high-density, high-throughput data, R is not a suitable language for the computation parts of 
the algorithm.

R/qtlHD is written in the high performance D programming language. D is chosen as primary 
language because it is created to perform safe and high throughput numerical analysis. D uses 
a C like syntax \cite{Alexandrescu:2011} providing a familiar syntax for the R/qtl developers, 
most of which come from a C/C++ background making D the language of choice for R/qtl-HD. 
Additional features of D include:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1pt
\item \emph{Improved code quality} - This makes the code more maintainability and more readable code is 
easier to reason about and optimize code, leading to improved performance of algorithms.
\item \emph{D allows to call C} - D allows to call C (and a limited subset of C++) functions directly. This 
allows to re-use previously written R/qtl code (written in R and C) \cite{RQTLGuide:2009}.
\item \emph{Build in unit testing} - Unit testing is build into the D programming language, allowing 
programmers to use the power of unit- and regression testing to build a test suite without the need 
for external tools or frameworks.
\item \emph{Concurrency and Actors} - The D language provides high level patterns such as Actors and 
Message Passing to deal with parallelisation of code. Unlike other languages, this is a build in 
feature of the language, this allows the standard D library to use safe lock free concurrency mechanisms \cite{Alexandrescu:2011}.
\item \emph{Static typing} - D requires types (e.g. Integer, Float, Double) to be declared and known 
at compile time, this improves readability of code and reduces the risk for run-time type errors of the system.
\item \emph{Compile Time Function Execution} - Compile time function execution (CTFE) is a feature 
that allows to build look up tables at compile time. This greatly reduces the run time of algorithms, 
by pre-calculating common cases \cite{ArendsBlog:2012}.
\end{enumerate}
These are the main reasons for the R/qtl development team to favor D over R.

The current version of R/qtl provides many tools for genetic map construction, but also several historical 
methods for QTL mapping. R/qtl-HD will not provide a multitude of methods but focus more on the high speed 
analysis of data using stable and proven methods such as Haley-Knott regression \cite{Haley:1992} and analysis of variance.
Additional features such as genetic map construction and validation are not high priority when converting 
the R/qtl software into a more optimized language. R/qtl-HD is designed for mapping huge volumes of phenotypes 
onto medium to large genetic maps \cite{Trelles:2011}.

Furthermore multiple QTL mapping (MQM) from R/qtl will also be converted into the D programming language.
The MQM routine has proven to be a useful addition to the R/qtl toolkit and with the new implementation 
of R/qtl as R/qtlHD, we aim to improve the usefulness even more. The major limitation in MQM is the 
additional computational load when compared to single marker QTL mapping \cite{Arends:2010}. The R/qtl 
development team is committed to 1) add the MQM routine to the R/qtlHD package and 2) provide further 
optimization to MQM to allow it to handle even large volumes of phenotype and genetic data. 

An overview of the features planned for the R/qtl-HD package:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1pt
\item \emph{Universal input format} - Based on our experiences with XGAP \cite{Swertz:2010a} and xQTL workbench 
\cite{Arends:2012}, QTAB was developed as input format for Rqtl-HD. A testing version of QTAB was implemented in 
R/qtl-HD by Pjotr Prins. The QTAB format aims to provide a universal solution to the storage of genotype and genetic 
maps in inbred populations.
\item \emph{Single marker QTL mapping} - R/qtl HD aims to provide the most common single marker mapping methods. 
These methods will be optimized to work with huge amounts of phenotype data, created by new technologies such as: 
Tilling arrays, RNA-seq and/or exome sequencing.
\item \emph{Multiple QTL mapping} - We aim to implement multiple QTL mapping and as such benefit from the added 
advantages of the D language such as: Reduced memory usage during run time and less run time due to the fact that 
it is easier to use parallel computation in D.
\item \emph{Gene x Environment} - We aim to implement a generic approach for Gene x Environment analysis, we believe 
this type of analysis to become more and more important in the future to untangle the relationship between genome and 
phenome.
\item \emph{R interface} - Current R/qtl users should be able to switch to R/qtl-HD, while keeping their familiar 
R interface. in an ideal world current users should automatically switch to R/qtl-HD without them noticing.
\item \emph{BioRuby} - Bio-packages are being created for many languages (Python, Perl, etc), Ruby is a new and 
upcoming language in the scientific field. R/qtl HD aims to provide bindings to the BioRuby project \cite{Goto:2010} 
as as proof of concept, other bio packages could model their own bindings on these Ruby bindings.
\item \emph{Compatibility} - R/qtl-HD aims to be compatible with the following operating systems: Mac OS X, 
Microsoft Windows and Debian Linux.
\end{enumerate}

R/qtlHD is developed as open source community software, currently a very limited version 
is available as preview for download. A development version is available from: 
\url{http://github.com/qtlHD/}

Further adaptations of the system currently not being considered, but which might be interesting opportunities for 
future work include: Integration of mapping analysis tools with genomic annotation and sequence data, generalization 
of analysis frameworks to accommodate not only mouse and human data but also data from other model organisms with 
different (non inbred) genetic pedigree structures, such as pets (e.g. cats, fish, dogs), farm animals (e.g. horses, 
cattle, pigs) and plants (e.g. arabidopsis, brassica, maize). Additional tools for genetic map construction might 
also be considered for inclusion, but currently are not a priority, since the current R package provides tools for 
this.

\section{Future perspectives}
\label{sect:Future}
With increasing scale of experimental data being produced in the lab, it will not be 
sufficient to have analysis software as simple downloads, because the researcher will 
also need sizable compute and storage power \cite{Schadt:2010}. Thus, researchers will 
need easy access to 'software as a service' such as cloud computing. Additionally storage 
of raw and pre-processed data is starting to become increasingly more expensive with 
increasing data sizes involved, this will be discussed in sections \ref{subsect:ClusterComputing} 
and \ref{sect:CloudComputing}. 
How this increasing demand for storage and computational power can be satisfied in the future remains 
an unanswered question. Although federate computing providers (such as Target or EU-grid) can help 
researcher in their need for big computing solutions in the near future. This is also not a 
universal solution, while the speed of data production is currently higher then the speed of 
CPU improvement \cite{Moore:1998, Editorial:2009, Shah:2013}. Two solutions which are 
currently already available are highlighted here: Cluster and cloud computing might be able to 
solve the Big Data questions researchers currently face.

Additionally reproducibility of analysis methodologies which involves a large code base is proving 
to be increasingly more difficult. results tend to slightly change when version of software and 
dependencies differ from the version used in the original analysis. A small discussion which highlights 
current solutions to this problem of irreproducible results is found in section \ref{sect:CodeSharing} 
about sharing code and collaborating on (large) code bases.

\subsection{Cluster computing}
\label{subsect:ClusterComputing}
A cluster is a collection of computers dedicated to solving a computational task by divide 
and conquer \cite{Silva:1999, Qiu:2010}. It basically means to having a basic relatively 
homogeneous software available on demand, on suitable compute and storage hardware. Hardware 
resources are divided by an internal scheduling system amongst different tasks form different 
users. However, users in general have little control over the computational environment, 
because administration of the cluster and the scheduling system put constraints on the usage 
of cluster. Computing clusters can be fashioned from different types of hardware, such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ad-hoc networks composed of many heterogeneous relatively cheap systems such as: FPGA, and/or CPU, ARM core
  \item Dedicated computer clusters, such as TARGET or national GRIDs, where usually a homogenous system of Linux machines is used for computational tasks.
  \item Video card cluster for linear algebra, utilizing the power of many simple GPU cores for dedicated tasks.
\end{itemize}
Compute clusters do not have to be homogeneous in nature. Though in many cases there will 
homogeneity to provide users with a stable computational environment to perform their tasks. 
Additionally the use of hardware can limit the usage of a cluster to a certain range of 
computational tasks such as GPUs or dedicated ARM cores.

\subsection{Cloud computing}
\label{sect:CloudComputing}
The term cloud is used in many different ways, and there is little consensus on what a cloud 
exactly is \cite{Foster:2008}. It essence it means to have software available 
on demand, on suitable compute and storage hardware, with the user being charged for the time 
that it is being used. Following the concept of the leading cloud provider Amazon, it refers 
in practice to use of a virtual Linux machine, i.e. a virtual compute server with Linux 
preinitialized, hosted within some large compute infrastructure, with complete freedom to be 
customized by the user although not for free \cite{Trelles:2011}.

Many commercial, national and local compute centers are also increasingly providing computer
server capacity in a cloud fashion. This makes these virtual machines an easy method to distribute 
software and computation without the need for all participating computational nodes to install 
software. Thus, the infrastructure is specified jointly \cite{Foster:2008} but for the actual computation every 
partner can be private with their data. This approach grants enormous computational power to 
everyone with minimal preparation - once that a shared image is finalized \cite{Krampis:2012}.

The setup of such a compute cloud is not trivial but several initiatives are underway to ease 
this process. At the workshop, the bioinformatics work-group tested the packaging system provided by 
the Debian Med initiative as a method to create a cloud and could be consider this as a seed 
for an image to then be publicly shared. Instructions to create such images were prepared for 
the workshop and made available at:\\
\url{http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/LiveCD/}
 
Using this method the cloud infrastructure can be transferred to local computer clusters 
if desired. Every participant has access to the server and can grant access to collaborators 
without having to pay the hosting fees. When complete, this server image can be ported to 
cloud providers such as: Amazon, Rackspace to be reused by other researchers.

\subsection{Code sharing and versioning}
\label{sect:CodeSharing}
Access and sharing of software code of all aforementioned tools is essential to avoid 
duplication of efforts, promote interoperability and to really collaborate within the 
genetics bioinformatics community. Only then does it really become clear what is available 
and how there can be data and software flow between projects.

An example tool to facilitate such sharing and collaboration on code level is Git: Git 
allows users to follow updates (versions) of software packages and easily provide feedback \cite{Git:2007}. 
The most recent stable R version of R/qtl and qtlHD can be found as a Git repository, Git 
helps to control versions for the authors and facilitate compatibility with other packages 
such as QTL-bim and Pheno2Geno. Although most users will generally find the last stable version 
(Git master branch) the most useful and user-friendly, it is possible to download a 
development branch to get familiar with the new features being prepared for the next version.

An alternative to Git is Subversion (SVN) \cite{SVN:2002}. GeneNetwork code was developed 
using Subversion with Python as its primary language. GeneNetwork code and a shell (partial) 
database are available on Source Forge \cite{GeneNetwork:1994, GeneNetwork:2004}:\\
\url{http://sourceforge.org/projects/genenetwork/}

xQTL and XGAP code were also developed in Subversion \cite{SVN:2002} using Java as its primary language and 
R for its analysis interfaces. XGAP code and binaries are all available as open source at
\url{http://www.xgap.org/} and \url{http://www.molgenis.org/}. From a developer's perspective both Git and
SVN are equally well-suited for publishing code and may be used in parallel.

\subsection{Final remarks}
The Pheno2Geno R package is available from Github, it is maintained by Konrad Zych and can be found at:\\
\url{https://github.com/KonradZych/phenotypes2genotypes}

In 2012 the MOLGENIS software suite (MOLGENIS, XGAP, xQTL workbench) was transferred to Git and 
moved to \url{http://www.github.com/} to get more online exposure, and remove the need to host 
an internal SVN server. Code and software can be found at:\\
\url{http://www.github.com/Molgenis/}

We urge all readers to adopt a professional and reproducible way of data analysis. This requires 
coding and collaboration using data provenance and repositories to store analysis code. All 
software developed for and described in this thesis are also written and developed using Git 
for source code control, and is available from Github at:\\

\section{Dutch Summary / Nederlandse Samenvatting}
Systeem genetica is een inter disciplinair veld wat zch bezig houdt met de gevolgen van 
genetische variatie op alle biomoleculaire niveaus een biologisch systeem. Het effect van 
deze genetische variantie leidt tot verschillen in phenotypes, zoals opbrengt en resistentie. 
Het doel van systeem genetica is het indelen van de oorzaken van deze geobserveerde 
phenotypische variatie in drie categorieen: Genetische effecten, omgevings effecten en 
(random) residuele error variantie. Door netwerken te bouwen van interacties tussen 
alle biomoleculaire niveaus probeert systeem genetics complexe phenotypes te verklaren uit 
het samenspel tussen deze niveaus.

Biologie gebruikt natuurlijke variatie en genetische pertubatie om de componenten te ontrafelen
die phenotypische variatie veroorzaken, deze metingen gecombineert met pertubatie van verschillende 
omgevingsfactoren staat ons toe om de invloed van verschillende effecten zoals omgeving en 
omgeving x genotype te bepalen. Experimenteel ontwerp and statistiek kunnen gebruikt worden om 
de error variantie te minimaliseren.

Hoofdstuk \ref{chap:introduction} becat een korte historische introductie over systeem genetics, 
In de volgende hoofdstukken van deze thesis laten de bijdrages zien van deze thesis aan systeem genetics.

Hoofdstuk \ref{chap:pheno2geno} (Pheno2Geno) gaat over het construeren van genetische kaarten vanuit grootschalige 
omics datasets. De theory achter het maken van genetische kaarten is ongeveer 100 jaar oud. Maar 
software beschikbaar voor het maken van genetische kaarten in model organismes is nog 
vaak nog niet aangepast aan nieuwe ontwikkelingen zoals multicore computers en cluster computing. 
Pheno2Geno is software voor het maken can genetische kaarten uit Big Data verkregen door 
experimenten de gebruik maken van tilling arrays of RNA sequence experimenten.

Hoofdstuk \ref{chap:mqm} omschrijft de implementatie van het multiple QTL mapping algorithme ontwikkeld door 
R. C. Jansen in R/qtl. Hiermee voegen we een nieuw algorithme aan de R/qtl toolset toe, een 
toolset speciaal ontwikkeld voor het mappen van QTLs in ingeteelde (mouse) populations. R/qtl 
vormt de basis van meerdere tools die allemaal gebouwd zijn rond een gedeelde datastructuur. 
Deze structuur maakt het makkelijk om software aan te passen en nieuwe tools toe te voegen.
Door de vele tools, kunnen onderzoekers snel wisselen van methode wanneer dit vereist is of 
verschillende methodes vergelijken zonder een nieuw software pakket te hoeven leren.

Huidige werkzaamheden over het gebruik van \emph{verschillen in correlatie} om interactie 
netwerken te genereren en celtype specifieke QTL effecten op te sporen wordt beschreven in 
hoofdstuk \ref{chap:ctlmapping}. Correlated Traits Locus analyse (of CTL mapping) laat 
onderzoekers toe om genetische loci te vinden die geassocieerd zijn met correlatie verschillen 
tussen segregerende phenotypes. Een variant op deze methode is waardevol gebleken om cel 
type specifieke eQTL effecten te ontdekken. Deze effecten kunnen worden gebruikt om mengsels 
van cellen te ontwarren zo als in geheel bloed gen expressie data.

In hoofdstuk \ref{chap:xqtlwormbench} presenteren we onze idee\"en voor een generiek opslag en rekenplatform 
voor systeem genetica. Ons demo systeem xQTL workbench wordt momenteel gebruikt als een 
backend voor de WormQTL en WormQTL-HD databases. In xQTL workbench kunnen gebruikers hun 
gegevens op slaan en delen in een lokale of webomgeving, en lopen analyse over datasets met 
behulp van de kracht van gedistribueerde computing. Het wordt standaard geleverd met QTL 
mapping tools, zoals: R/QTL, Plink en qtlbim maar ook biedt het een web inferface, data 
importers, API's en visualisaties.

Ik vertrouw erop dat je geniet van het lezen van dit proefschrift, zoals ik heb genoten van het maken 
ervan.

human GWA study (chapter \ref{sec:cellspecificeqtl}), I learned a LOT from you, and am 
extremely thankful for your help with the final chapters of this thesis. 

I have been very lucky to meet and work together with some of the cleverest minds in animal breeding 
and genetics. Being able to discuss my ideas with people such as {\bf Karl Broman}, {\bf Gary Churchill}, 
{\bf Allen Attie} and {\bf Brian Yandell} made me push myself to the limits and beyond. I would like 
to thank all of you for the nice times I had across the pacific ocean. 
Additionally I was lucky to have good collaboration with Wageningen University, especially {\bf Wilko 
Ligterink}, {\bf Henk Hilhort} and {\bf Ronny Joosen} for doing the \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} 
experiments, and trusted me to analyze their data. I learned a lot especially about the more 'biological' 
parts of this thesis. 

Furthermore I have had the pleasure to work with many dedicated students along the way: 
My student {\bf Konrad Zych} for his dedication and help with Pheno2Geno and chapter \ref{chap:pheno2geno}. 
{\bf Mark de Haan} for his work on the xQTL workbench system and the review work on Pheno2Geno.
{\bf Yalan Bi} for working on the \emph{A. thaliana} gene expression data and alternative splicing 
work, which unfortunately was not finished in time for this thesis. And {\bf Adriaan van der Graaf} for 
showing me that even jocks can be turned into nerds. And naturally all the other students I have been 
privileged to work with during these last years.

I would like to thank the {\bf European Union} for setting up the {\bf SysGeNet} network, I've met 
many people and learned a lot about the mouse community in Europe. Especially I would like to thank 
{\bf Klaus Schughart} for starting and maintaining the network, and {\bf Leonard Schalkwyk} for 
inviting me to the UK for a lecture series at King's College.

{\bf Richard Stremme} and {\bf Evert van der Velde} for always being available after work for a beer and providing
entertainment and the needed distraction when being fed up with writing this thesis.
The {\bf University of Groningen} (RUG) for educating me and providing me with an place to do my research. And 
finally the {\bf University Medical Centre Groningen} (UMCG) for the pleasant working atmosphere and good lunches.

Danny Arends was born on the 15th of Juli 1983 in the city of Zwolle located in the heart 
of the Netherlands. After moving twice, Danny went to an elementary school situated in 
Heiligerlee, a minuscule hamlet in the north of Holland in the province of Groningen. 

The small school was a perfect match for young Danny during his childhood. Here he quickly 
fell in love with mathematics, and the wondrous world of numbers and patterns. With the 
advent of computers at the elementary school, the love for computers and their inner 
workings also began to develop.

Heiligerlee is located next to a small forest called 'De Hoogte', this forest was used 
by Danny and friends on a daily basis to build tree huts and by using snow balls in winter 
wage war on kids from the other school in Heiligerlee. The forest combined with growing up 
amidst animals on a farm-like residence sparked young Danny his intrests in biology.

After elementary school Danny went to the Ubbo Emmius lyceum in Stadskanaal (Groningen). 
The large scale VWO was a big change compared to the small elementary school. Long hours at school 
together with a long bus ride to and from school, made for long days. Fortunately new 
friends were made in the class room and during the long bus rides. Danny finished high 
school after 6 years, taking mostly exact courses such as mathematics, physics and chemistry.

At 17, a university degree should be the next step in his career. Because of his interests 
in computers, Danny decided that computer science would be a good match. This turned out 
to be not so true. While deeply intrigued by the subject of computational machines, he 
was not satisfied by just studying the workings of a machine build by man.

After two years of Computer science at the University of Groningen, Danny decided it was time 
for a change. Computer science was replaced by Life Science \& Technologie, a bachelor which 
was recently formed as a collaboration between the Biology faculty and Medical Sciences.

He finished his bachelor in record tempo, partly due to the exemptions obtained from 
doing two years of computer science. A Master in molecular biology was quickly selected after
being introduced to bioinformatics at GBIC during a previous bachelor project. The molecular 
biology master allowed for customization of the courses followed, and bioinformatics became the main 
theme in all of the master theses produced. The first thesis: "Machine learning to predict 
transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes" was produced in the group of Oscar Kuipers. 
The second master thesis about 'R/QTL, MQM algorithm' was done in the lab of Ritsert C. Jansen 
under the supervision of Pjotr Prins.

Parts of this second master project are found in this thesis (chapter \ref{chap:mqm}).
After graduating his university master Cum Laude. Danny started a PHD project at Ritsert 
C. Jansen at the Groningen Bioinformatics Centre with a focus on the use of bioinformatic 
tools to handle current challenges in genetics and statistics. These four years of research 
at the GBIC have resulted in the thesis you are currently reading.\\\\
