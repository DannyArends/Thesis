\section*{Dutch Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Dutch Summary}
Systems genetics is the inter disciplinairy field which deals with the consequences of genetic 
variation on a biological system. The goal of systems genetics is to partition this variation 
into three major categories: Genetic, Environment and Error variation, and explain how complex
phenotypes arise from a combination of these three major factors.  Natural variation (or 
genetic pertubation) is used to interogate the genetic component of phenotype variation. 
Combined with environmental pertubation we can investigate the influence different 
environments and the interaction between genetics and environment. Experimental design and 
statistics are used to minimize and estimate error variance.

Pheno2Geno (Chapter 2) deals with the creation of genetic maps from large scale omics data. 
The theory of genetic map construction is ~100 years old. Software available for genetic map 
construction has not been adapted yet to make use of new technologies such as multi threading 
or cluster computing. Pheno2Geno aims to provide analysis of data from tilling arrays or RNAseq 
to generate gene based expression markers and create high density genetic maps.

Chapter 3 describes the implementation of the Multiple QTL mapping routine by R. C. Jansen into 
R/qtl. Adding a 'new' algorithm to the R/qtl toolset which aims to provide a range of QTL 
mapping tools for inbred crosses. R/qtl is the basis of a toolset build around a unified 
data structure allowing easy adaptation and extension of the software. R/qtl allows researchers 
to analyse data from different sources or to quickly compare different approaches.

In chapter 4 we show case our ideas for a generic storage and computation platform for systems 
genetics. Our demo system xQTL workbench is currently being used as a backend to the 
WormQTL and WormQTL-HD database. xQTL workbench allows users to store and share their data in 
a local or web environment, and run analysis across datasets using the power of distributed 
computing. It comes standard with QTL mapping tools such as: R/qtl, PLINK and qtlbim but also
provides a web inferfaces, data importers, APIs and visualizations.

Current work on using differences in correlation to generate interaction networks and detect 
cell type specific QTL effects is described in chapter 5. Correlated Traits Locus analysis 
(or CTL mapping) enables researchers to find genetic loci controlling correlation differences 
in segregating phenotypes. A variation on this method has proven valuable in discovering cell 
type specific eQTL effects. These effects can be used to untangle cell mixtures seen in whole 
blood gene expression data.

%In short this proposed method creates a proxy for cell counts in an unrelated cohort. this proxy 
%is then used during meta analysis as artifical cell count across many different cohorts. The 
%interaction effects between QTL and Proxy are used to assign a cell type to each eQTL. In the final 
%stage diseases in which cell type enrichment is prominent are tested by using publicly available data.

Last we have some additional required chapters, such as this summary in Dutch, a CV and publication 
list and bibliography.\\

I hope you enjoy reading this thesis as much as I enjoyed creating it during the last four years,\\\\

Danny Arends was born on the 15th of Juli 1983 in the city of Zwolle located in the heart of the 
Netherlands. After moving twice, Danny went to an elementary school situated in Heiligerlee, a minuscule 
hamlet in the north of Holland in the province of Groningen. The small school was a perfect 
match for small Danny, whom quickly fell in love with mathematics. With the advent of 
computers at the elementary school, also the love for computer science began to develop. 
Heiligerlee is located next to a small forrest called 'De Hoogte', this forrest was used 
by Danny and friends on a daily basis to build tree huts and wage war on kids from the other 
school in Heiligerlee using snow balls in winter. Combined with growing up amidst the animals 
on a small farm-like residence also sparked young Danny his intrest in biology 

After elementary school Danny went to the Ubbo Emmius lyceum in Stadskanaal (Groningen). 
The large scale VWO was a big change from the small elementary school. Combined with a 
long bus ride to and from school, made for long days. Fortunately new friends were made in 
the class room and during the long bus rides. Danny finished high school after 6 years with a 
Cum Laude, taking mostly exact courses such as mathematics, physics and chemistry.

At 17, Danny thought that a university degree should be the next step in his career.
Because of his interests in computers, Danny decided that computer science would be a good 
match. This turned out to be not so true. While deeply devoted to the computational machines, 
Danny was not satisfied by just studying the workings of a machine build by man.

After two years of Computer science at the University of Groningen, Danny decided it was time 
for a change. Computer science was replaced by Life Science \& Technologie, a bachelor which 
was recently formed as a collaboration between the Biology faculty and Medical Sciences.

He finished his bachelor in record tempo, partly due to the exemptions obtained from 
doing two years of computer science. A Master in molecular biology was quickly selected after
being introduced to bioinformatics at GBIC during a previous bachelor project. The molecular 
biology master allowed for customization of the courses followed, and bioinformatics became the main 
theme in all of the master theses produced. The first thesis: "Machine learning to predict 
transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes" was produced in the group of Oscar Kuipers. 
The second "R/QTL, MQM algorithm" was done in the lab of Ritsert C. Jansen.

Parts of this second master thesis are also in this thesis (chapter \ref{chap:mqm}).
After finishing his master Cum Laude, a PHD was started with Ritsert C. Jansen at the 
Groningen Bioinformatics Centre with a focus on the use of bioinformatic tools to handle 
current challenges in genetics and statistics. The four years of research at GBIC have 
lead to the thesis you are currently reading.\\\\
