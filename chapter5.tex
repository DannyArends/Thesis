\chapter{Mapping correlation}

\emph{In this chapter we take one step further then in the previous chapters and develop a new methodology for
quantitative genetics called Correlated Traits Locus (CTL) mapping, a method complementairy to QTL mapping. 
Where QTL associates differences in mean, CTL, associate differences in correlation to genetic variation, i.e. 
CTL identify regions in the genome for which one genotype leads to correlated expression between a pair of 
traits, while the other genotype shows none (or significantly different) correlation.}
