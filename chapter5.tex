\chapter{Mapping correlation}

\emph{In this chapter we develop a new methodology to be used in quantitative genetics 
called Correlated Traits Locus (CTL) mapping, a method complementairy to QTL mapping. 
Where QTL associates differences in mean, CTL, associate differences in correlation to 
genetic variation, i.e. CTL identify regions in the genome for which one genotype leads 
to correlated expression between a pair of traits, while the other genotype shows none 
(or significantly different) correlation.}
